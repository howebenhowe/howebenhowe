# Untitled
after Roberto Bola√±o

When she arrives it's too late,
a delicious inconvenience to think
of her. Tucked in a stuffed chair legs stretched
and a book in hand and my mind with anything
but words. Somewhere else. Someone
else. Both, but contaminating me here now. The soft cheek,
one curving idea warps reason and thread
until I'm dumb and saturated with shape.
She said goodbye into city streets. I watched
her confident steps square across mine, into a bustle
it might be the ocean. Heading home fizzing
about the chest and the picture of her sailing across the street.
The boy opposite is smiling even if he isn't, because I'm a scattering discoball.
