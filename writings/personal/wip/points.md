## subway fare

After the twelfth subway fare in a week, the rest are free. Twelve scions of the men's room in regiment with briefcase, then five with billowing jacket, disco hip, opposite finger to the sky.

Is it worth it, jumping the turnstile? The fare to ride has climbed to $2.90--a fresh high water mark, a perpetual flood tide. Davy avoids fare every time they can, multiple times a day.

$2.90, $5.80, $8.70

A few gymnastic trivialities earn them weed for the week, make a dent in expenses toward rent. When Davy got busted I had just swiped myself through before them, but saw the police too late to alert Davy. The one who noticed had only just, I saw him tilt his head back in preemptive exasperation for the dressing-down he had to deliver. Davy deflated. Their posture is always bad, back curled like a shrimp and head hung forward like a predator--but it's a projection of defiant attitude. When the cop spoke ("Excuse me--" has never been such a lie) the funky steam that powers Davy just leaked out their ears. Game over. $100 fine on an oversized carnival ticket. That's 35 rides, or three weeks, for Davy. Caleb's savvier, always passing to the second gallery of turnstiles so he can survey the whole mezzanine before his hop. Still, pinched eventually. Caleb, are you going to pay that ticket?

"No. I jump so I don't have to pay. Why would I start now?" Game on.

## games, credit cards

In Street Fighter 2 (1991), if you time them just right, you can chain together several moves so that your opponent doesn't have a chance to react. One of the game's engineers noticed the bug during development, but left the mechanic in the code assuming it would be too difficult for players to exploit. Those "combos" are now present as a deliberate feature of every competitive fighting game. Players will accumulate dozens of uninterrupted strikes, a tattoo until technical knockout.

The biggest credit card bonuses are available only when you sign up. The pot sweeteners. They typically require you to make a sequence of purchases within the first months. For example, if you sign up for an American Express Platinum card with a referral code and spend $6000 in the first six months, you'll be rewarded with 150,000 Membership Rewards Points (valued at $0.015 per point, so approximately $2250) plus a $200 statement credit, though the annual card fee of $695 can't be waived. That was English. Through decentralized fora, a community of the righteously greedy have worked out how to game the banks. They time signing up and canceling cards, shuffle debt between accounts, and net many thousands of dollars per year. The calculations and advice available are studded with anti-bank sentiments, but it's the high scores ("$12k last year, without Chase.") that earn awe.

## candy crush

I read once that Candy Crush Saga was the company with the highest average employee salary. Something in excess of two hundred thousand dollars per year per person, apportioned along some leaderboard scheme across a fistful of programmers. Square-fitted jelly beans and peppermint hard candy cascade relentlessly, a confectionery's slot machine. I can't see what his screen is playing into his face, but the cacophony of smashing, tinkling, and zooming from opposite my seat on the train brings the images clearly to my mind. Maybe he plays perfectly, is found by the singular rush of triumph that comes from translating impulse and aptitude into a contrived system. More likely it's just candy, sweetening the gray morning commute in to work, his tenth subway ride this week.

## language acquisition

Those micro-transaction games get me down, how baldly they are engineered to addict. I release the man and drop my gaze back to my own phone, the next Spanish language flashcard. "It is inconceivable that there are people who do not believe in climate change." I know this one! Tricky though, and I forget the second subjunctive conjugation. Swipe left, repeat it later, 14 incorrect, 75 correct and a twenty day streak of accumulating vocabulary.

## dating apps
+ the look/feel is a game
+ limit to how many swipes you can put up, but you can buy more (same as lives in candy crush)

## grades
+ the integrity of an interaction goes up once grades aren't part of it, for example, Caleb's running relationship with Sam is all office hours, pro bono

## messages (notifications) and emails
+ (unread) counter bubbles
+ people silencing their phones
+ "omg, my bff rose" => pitching high-speed texting as desireable for old and young => the more you chit-chat with messages the more engaged you are

## Facebook friend count => influencer audience count => reactions, traction

## habit tracking
+ the unbroken chain
+ showing it to my brother
+ AA tokens
+ 

## aware of our inclination toward games, we manipulate ourselves for better and worse
