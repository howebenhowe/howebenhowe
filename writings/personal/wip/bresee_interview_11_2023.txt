Ben (00:01):
Okay, we record. This is Benjamin Howe. November 8th, 2023. Remember something talking with Peter Brize. Peter, Dominic, Brize. Peter, do I have your consent to record this? This call doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. We're in single party state. Uh, yes.

Peter (00:21):
Yep.

Ben (00:22):
Correct. Single party state. I can record you if I wanna,

Mostly Peter (00:26):
But there's two states involved. This is federal shit.

Ben (00:28):
I don't actually know how this works. <laugh>.

Peter (00:32):
Ooh,

Ben (00:36):
Fresh. 90 minute, 90 minute tape. I'm definitely gonna run this thing. Um, does this,

Peter (00:42):
I find the plug

Ben (00:43):
For the tape recording.

Peter (00:45):
Just,

Ben (00:45):
Just grab all like 12 D batteries. It needs,

Peter (00:52):
It is like somewhere, like, honestly, I don't, it should not be far from all the other shit.

Ben (01:06):
Pete, do you have any idea which stories you'd like to talk about?

Mostly Peter (01:10):
I don't know. I'm thinking about it right now. I almost can't remember Any stories

Ben (01:16):
Or for example, a chapter of life that you'd wanna talk about?

Mostly Peter (01:23):
Yeah, I mean, I think the, the probably the most interesting or talk about would probably be like post maybe and up until like covid, I guess

Ben (01:39):
Check out all these batteries. So many batteries. Yeah. That sounds like a suitable period of time. Did you see all those batteries? Did you see all four of them? It's a lot of batteries.

Mostly Peter (01:51):
Oh, well, yeah.

Peter (01:55):
<laugh> one Big D. It doesn't work

Ben (01:59):
Though, does it? ftd? Are they

Peter (02:00):
Dead? Or, I guess we could check.

Ben (02:05):
Yeah, they're dead. They're

Peter (02:06):
Dead. Okay. It doesn't have like an on button does it?

Ben (02:11):
Attention mic.

Peter (02:13):
Oh, it's

Ben (02:16):
DC nine volt. I

Peter (02:17):
Know. There's like a fucking plug. I know exactly what it looks like. It's so annoying. <inaudible>.

Ben (02:22):
All right, well we're recording anyway. If it should, if it should appear, it'd be a fun thing to, anyway. Anyway, um, yeah. When did you get outta the Navy?

Mostly Peter (02:39):
Uh, January 23rd, 2017 was my first day out. How,

Ben (02:44):
How'd you feel when you got out? What did it look like when you got out? What was getting out? Did you have to like hand in your gun and badge?

Mostly Peter (02:53):
Yeah, but it's way more intensive than that as far as paperwork goes.

Ben (02:59):
I remember they had me fill out so much paper. I love it,

Mostly Peter (03:03):
Dude. It's not a, it's not a joke. <laugh>, you get this fucking folder and it has like, uh, I don't know, two dozen, maybe 30 signatures that you need from various people who are responsible for various specific things. And since they only have one fucking thing they look after, they are very serious about that. So you're like, okay, I need to go convince this person that I am absolutely squeaky clean in their particular department. And then just do that over and over and over and over and over, over with all these like fucking officious clerks that are wearing camouflage for some reason.

Ben (03:40):
<laugh> sitting at a desk, <laugh>, you walk in and you're like, oh, I didn't notice you there, <laugh>.

Mostly Peter (03:47):
Yeah. And I actually had a pretty serious problem because I had had my car broken into maybe like six months prior, and all of my many thousands of dollars of like armor and like CVRN gear, just like chemical, biological, radiological, neurological protection gear, shit that just stays sealed in a bag. But I would never, ever use ever, ever, ever. And even if I needed to, would die before I figured out how to unseal the bag. <laugh>.

Ben (04:17):
See, I can't unseal this. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Gagging on chemicals design was, it was just like this

Mostly Peter (04:23):
Huge, huge camelo duffle that we had to bring around with us to all our posts just because it was on a piece of paper somewhere that we had to have that. And it literally just served as a pillow. That's what it did. <laugh> not a very good, a very lumpy filled with like hard plastics kind of pillow. Anyway, my car was broken into my fucking cold queue was stolen out of it, which was the worst. I loved that stick. An old Joss,

Ben (04:51):
Do you name

Mostly Peter (04:51):
Them? And uh, yeah. What did I call that one? Medusa.

Ben (04:56):
Medusa, that's right. Goodbye. Medusa.

Mostly Peter (04:59):
Medusa. You see it and you're petrified. Hey, by the side of it, you know. Anyway, I had all my shit stolen and it was like thousands of dollars that I didn't have, but also had to go through all this like, was it your fault? Kind of shit to determine if I had to pay for it or not. And that process took so long as does all paperwork in the military that I was not able to finish that by the time my contract was over <laugh>.

Ben (05:25):
So it both

Mostly Peter (05:28):
<laugh>. So I had to basically lie, do the best lying that I could and like, well, so-and-so said to do X, Y, and Z. And then they referred me to other, so-and-So, and like basically just tried to fool all these clerks into saying, the other clerks said things that would get me to get this signed. It was like, he won't sign it until he signs it. He won't sign it until he signs it. And, and no, they should, none of them should have done it, but they all did. And I got out <laugh>

Ben (05:57):
<laugh>, batten your lashes outta,

Mostly Peter (06:01):
Never did I have to pay for that year. I had something like 75 days of paid vacation that I hadn't used, which I was able to sell. What I didn't know was that you can only sell up to 60 of 'em. So I should have taken 15 more

Ben (06:17):
Was the car. That was the car. You didn't own that car yet, right?

Mostly Peter (06:22):
No, I was still paying for it. Yeah. So

Ben (06:25):
There's a bag of stuff that belonged to the US government in a car that still belonged to the bank. There's a pool cou queue that belonged to you and <laugh>. I don't know how to make sense of all those parts. I'll worry about that later when I write it all down, but that's kind of fun. That's all.

Mostly Peter (06:40):
Yeah, it was rough. And uh, and so I got out and it was like, right, it was January. It was the fucking Pacific Northwest. I had no plan, nowhere to go, nothing to do. I had these $5,000 check from selling my vacation. I weezled my way out of the three or 4,000 that I had to pay for the gear. And I had recently gotten syphilis from some woman. And so I was covered all at one side of my body with these awful marks. And I didn't know yet that it was syphilis. So I was just like, basically I'm getting outta the military. I know what I'm gonna do and there's something horribly wrong with me. My dick was all fucked up too. And uh, or can I say dick?

Ben (07:28):
You can say Dick.

Mostly Peter (07:32):
Anyway,

Ben (07:32):
You wanna share some more symptoms or are you gonna call it a dick? Is that, is that the line that, is that where we draw the line

Mostly Peter (07:39):
Symptoms? Oh dude, it was like crusted over. It was, it had like a big fucking like thin ass light colored scab on it. And I was just like, this is not good. <laugh> and everything was basically, everything was bad. And I remember like sitting in my car and it was dark and rainy at like 4:42 PM and I was like, you know what, let's head down to the <inaudible> bridge. It just jump up. That's a good plan. Uh, that's, you know, I just, my brain just goes to that. It's like, quit just fuck this shit. But I didn't do that.

Ben (08:14):
<laugh>, sell some more vacation. <laugh>, I'll sell you. Tell you what, I'll sell you the rest. You could have it all cash out. All my vacations,

Mostly Peter (08:25):
All my vacation. Yeah. So it was, it was bleak, man. I remember that. And, uh, I went to, I, I drove, I drove over the SCSS and uh, up into Seattle and I needed a place to stay. So naturally I went to the pool hall and there, there was, I, I had, I mean, I'm, to this day I'm really close friends with the owner of the pool. Which one? David Azi. David Azi. Golden Fleece, billiards. Shout out. Um, and I already had a key to the place. So there's a couch, I have a key <laugh>. So I started just staying at, at the Golden fleece.

Ben (09:13):
You thought you're gonna be like, so I went and I could talk to Dave and ask him if he knew anybody about a place I could stay. And you're like, I had that place. His place was also my place

Mostly Peter (09:24):
Pretty much. I mean he was like a, like a very much a mentor and kind of father figure type guy for me.

Ben (09:32):
Type guy. Hardworking, hardworking pair of words there. So you're Shaq at the Fleece You and Medusa at the Golden Fleece? Yeah. No more Medusa Medusa's Gone.

Mostly Peter (09:43):
No, no more Medusa. I actually, I replaced that with a Mederma D 15. They, uh, kind of a a not that nice stick from the year 1984, which later found its way split in two over my knee after being thrown as a Ja and out the back door of a bar in the finals of a pool tournament.

Ben (10:03):
I've heard about this.

Mostly Peter (10:06):
Yep. Jabbed it out the back door. Went out there, split it in half and tossed it on top of the borrower. It's to this day,

Ben (10:12):
Um, clog it up the gutter, causing it to spill over the side. What name did you give that particular pool queue?

Mostly Peter (10:20):
I don't think I named that one. I don't remember if I did.

Ben (10:23):
Didn't Earn My Love. Didn't earn a name.

Mostly Peter (10:26):
It just two. Yeah. Um, Medusa space. TOO.

Ben (10:31):
How about M-E-D-E-A-U-X-S-A. Medusa.

Mostly Peter (10:37):
Yeah. That's good. Great.

Ben (10:40):
A joke. You can't tell the jokes. You can spell the really, really good ones are the ones you have to spell.

Mostly Peter (10:47):
Yes.

Ben (10:48):
Ouch. What'd I do

Mostly Peter (10:50):
Be? Yeah, so I was staying with the fleece and so I need, you know, I have a little stack of cash, but I needed work and, uh, one of the guys that was kind of like one of my customers at the fleece, the guy I would regularly play for 10 or 20 bucks a game and you know, he'd shell out 80 bucks or whatever just for the opportunity to maybe learn a little something. I was like, his name's Alex, like Alex, I need a job. And he is like, great, I've got a manager. I'd love to fire. And he was <laugh>.

Ben (11:24):
This is one of the clubs.

Mostly Peter (11:27):
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Alex was the GM of Sands, uh, sands Showgirls.

Ben (11:32):
Mallard Sands. Was it just Sands or did it have a more complete name?

Mostly Peter (11:37):
Sands. Sands Showgirls. S-A-D-S-A-N-D-S. Short wheels.

Ben (11:44):
Why did he So yeah,

Mostly Peter (11:45):
He fired somebody. And

Ben (11:46):
Why do his place, why do you wanna fire him?

Mostly Peter (11:51):
Um, yeah, I think it was kind of like a turf dispute situation. It's kind of funny, like when you are at this club, which is not a very corporate club, it's not at all a corporate club, it's just the only one owned by a family. So like, you're not really supposed to do this, but you accept tips from the girls who work there. So because of that, you want to have like a, a good staff on your shifts so that you can, they, you know, they make more money and then you make a cut of that. So I think the situation with him was that there were some high earners that Alex was concerned, was working more shifts with this other guy and it was cutting into his profits. So he wanted to get this guy outta there so that the girls that were drifting to him wouldn't be doing that anymore. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I was put in there, I don't know, that's some, that's some cousin of a Patsy. I think.

Ben (12:55):
<laugh>. I also love a mom and pop strip club. Not one of those corporate giants, you know, real mom and pop before they got muscled out by Amazon's strip club endeavor

Mostly Peter (13:08):
Strip club. I mean, it's real though. Like the corporate headquarters of Dreamgirls, LLC is in downtown Seattle. That's where the company started and they have like a hundred clubs around the country. So there's only three, I think in the metro area that are not part of that outfit.

Ben (13:31):
No kidding.

Mostly Peter (13:31):
Which since it's part of, anyhow, anyhow, so I got the job, I had a little interview. I fucking, I had just gotten done as I was exiting the Navy I had interviewed for, after going through the laborious process that is before interviewing, uh, a bunch of police departments. I had gone and done like about that. I dunno, it's 10 or 15 police department interviews, which are like panel interviews. You dress up real nice and you put some goop in your hair and you just do your fucking best how they're terrifying.

Ben (14:04):
You were still Navy cut then? I guess so. Like high and tight? No mustache with mustache,

Mostly Peter (14:11):
I think. None. None

Ben (14:12):
St Yeah.

Mostly Peter (14:14):
Yeah. I didn't have a stash in the Navy except for like a small period of time. I wasn't ready for that responsibility yet. So

Ben (14:22):
Ready for, ready for a responsibility for a nuclear warhead protection. But you know, yeah. Mustache is a bit much.

Mostly Peter (14:31):
Right? Yeah. So yeah, I done all those cop interviews. So I went and did this interview with Alicia at the, uh, at the office two doors down from the club, and she was very impressed and I was hired. It was great. So working there a little bit. And then I, uh, I, I guess I enrolled at, what do you call it, the college South Seattle Community College in West Seattle. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, of course. Uh, and with the GI Bill, they were paying me like fucking like 2,600 a month as well as paying for my classes. But I had to be in school full time and I was working the script club job full time, and it wasn't even possible for me to attend all my classes. I would go to the first, like seven minutes of my last class and then screech up to Ballard to go work all day.

(15:31):
I was doing both of these things at once. So I was making a lot of money. I was making like, probably at least 5,000 a month. And so I got a place with my uncle in Ballard, just a few blocks from the club. And I was basically just bawling outta control. I was like, I got a car, I got a job, I got, I got school, I got all this money. There's strippers everywhere. I'm gonna do some drugs. That's what I'm gonna do. This is gonna be great. And, uh, so, and then I also was, I was still, I mean, absolutely obsessed with pool, so I was playing a lot of pool. You know, I'd go to, I'd go to school from like, whatever, eight o'clock in the morning to like 12 or so. I'd go to work from 12 to eight, then I'd go to the pool from eight to two, and then I go to school again the next day.

Ben (16:28):
Gotcha. So screeching in or catching the last seven minutes of your last class is off of? I needed to sleep is off of, I stayed up playing pool is off of, uh, doing drugs and off of, I just got off work and I went unwind and off of, and around and round, round.

Mostly Peter (16:42):
Yeah. I would like go, I would go from the pool hall to the fucking Coke dealer and then like, it'd be like, you know, six in the morning and I'd be like, okay, I guess I better like fucking blow my nose and take a shower. Do it again. You know? So yeah, that was hard. Um, kind of a bit of a blur. And uh,

Ben (17:07):
How long was that stretch? Like that routine lasted six months,

Mostly Peter (17:14):
A year, I think. Yeah, I think two, like two quarters or whatever. They got 'em broken up as.

Ben (17:19):
Yeah.

Mostly Peter (17:21):
Um, yeah. And then I had to drop, I just had to drop school. I was like, there's no fucking way I can do all these things. I mean, in retrospect, obviously that would be the last thing I should have dropped, but that's what I, that's what I chose, I guess, because I was just so discouraged from failing, you know?

Ben (17:39):
Yeah. And also, I mean, you in school have been, I don't know, not the closest bedfellows through time. It, it was ripe. It was ripe for your ire, you know, I remember you, I remember talking to you about that and you were like, fuck school. Like there was kind of a bone to pick about it.

Mostly Peter (17:59):
Yeah, I just, uh, I don't know, man. I'm fucking, I'm 30 now and I wish I could just go back and just beat some sense into myself, but I, I just never, I just never had the discipline for it. And I didn't have a good excuse. I used fucking sophomore philosophy to tell myself that school was bullshit. But whether or not it is, I mean, I certainly could have benefited from participating in a meaningful way. And, um, instead of, I don't know, convincing myself that it was nonsense and I was above it.

Ben (18:33):
You said if <laugh>, I wish I could go back there and beat some senses myself. If time travel existed, the number of times I would've seen you like about to take an action and look up fearful that future you is about to come and slap you across the face. <laugh> fuck, he keeps doing this <laugh>. Every time I'm about to have some fun, this asshole comes back and beats me anyway.

Mostly Peter (18:55):
Yeah, right. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and yeah, working at the club, um, there was a coworker of mine, uh, it's a waitress, uh, Presley, you know, the, I I fell in love with her. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> had to work with her. She was unavailable for a long time until years later. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> botched that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>.

Ben (19:20):
Mm-Hmm. <laugh>.

Mostly Peter (19:23):
Um, yeah. So I got outta school and had this money that I now still owe from the GI Bill, and I used drugs to spend the money. He used drugs to spend the money, whatever, man. Um, and in 2018, I decided to quit doing everything. I don't know what came first, the quitting or the mania, but I just did. I was like, I'm gonna quit smoking. I'm gonna quit drinking. Uh,

Ben (20:09):
I remember this phone call. I'm gonna quit

Mostly Peter (20:11):
Getting drugs. And I did. I quit all that shit. And I was feeling good, man. I was like hitting the deck and giving myself 20 pushups like every fucking 15 minutes. I was just like, I'm powerful animal.

Ben (20:24):
Wait, hold on. Also, somewhere around this time you took a, a mix of drugs.

Mostly Peter (20:34):
I took a mix of drugs. Yeah. This was like

Ben (20:37):
Dissociative. Psychedelic. Wasn't that that same

Mostly Peter (20:40):
Period? Yeah, maybe. Yeah. Maybe that was like when I made the decision, whatever that brain, it was like, stop doing this stuff, you know? But yeah, I took a bunch of DXM to associative right. And, um, and a bunch of mushrooms at once. And, uh, woke up from that and couldn't really speak. It was weird. I, uh, I sounded like, um, like a caricature of like a, like a disabled mentally disabled person. Like, like really high voice and like, couldn't really make my mouth do stuff. I was like, what is going on like that? But I was like trying to talk, you know, regular, huh? No, that, yeah, that was fucking weird. I mean, I must have fucking hit some, one of them reset buttons. You need a fucking pen cap to hit, you know, <laugh>.

Ben (21:43):
Oh, I learned today. Brief aside, paperclips in French are called trombone as in trombone because that's the shape of the coil. They just called it, they just called them the French word for trombone. That makes, I need

Mostly Peter (21:57):
A trombone,

Ben (21:58):
I need a trombone step for this paper.

Mostly Peter (22:02):
That's cool. Nice aside. Yeah. So yeah, that only, that only lasted like, you know, a couple hours or whatever. I remember like when I was on that, like seeing, like looking at the clock and analog clock and watching it slow down and then reverse direction and then come forward again and stop like clock with a second hand, just like doing whatever the fuck it wanted to do. It really tripped me out.

Ben (22:32):
Where, where are you

Mostly Peter (22:35):
At my house or at my apartment in Ballard alone. That's where I was. But yeah, John Ball wasn't there.

Ben (22:42):
You had just gone out scooped this particular cocktail of drugs, come home and been like, all right, this is what we're doing today.

Mostly Peter (22:50):
Yeah, I think I actually took the DXM pills. So I found some pills like, while I was out for a drive, because it's kind of fun to drive on those. And then, uh, and then went back to the place when they like really started coming on heavy, then like went for a walk and then sat on a curb and scarfed the mushrooms

Ben (23:09):
Curb,

Mostly Peter (23:09):
Which I don't even think I was, I, I was planning on doing weeded 'cause I was familiar with that cocktail. Mm-Hmm. But I, I was unable to like buy weed in that, in that state, but I already had a bag of mushroom, so I was like, this'll do. Yeah.

Ben (23:26):
The curb is your altar,

Mostly Peter (23:28):
Dude, I love the curb.

Ben (23:29):
I know you love the curb. It's one curb wrapping all the way around. Um, where would you buy your drugs? Where in Seattle is the drug scene? Like your corners, your spots? Do you have elsewhere?

Mostly Peter (23:42):
Oh no. You just, like, you connect with guy and then you just text him or call him. Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. You, yeah, I mean, for, for like powder cocaine, when I later started doing like crack, I, that is when you have to like, kind of go on the street and be like, Hey, street people, <laugh> where is, where, where's the, where's the local Earl <laugh>? You know?

Ben (24:10):
So it's kinda like going mushroom hunting in the woods where you, like, you gotta really know what you're looking for. And then you start spotting the mushrooms. 'cause you've developed, you've got your eyes on, you've like got the Yeah.

Mostly Peter (24:19):
The X-ray. Yeah. You know, when you, you know, when somebody knows somebody

(24:24):
<laugh>

Ben (24:25):
You, like you're connected in low places. Tell me, could you connect me to

Mostly Peter (24:31):
Take me to a node? Take me to a node. Yeah.

Ben (24:34):
Gotcha.

Mostly Peter (24:35):
Um, but yeah, that's, so that's, that's that. Um, yeah, so I stopped doing all 'em, all 'em shits and uh, was feeling great. I was playing the best pool in my life. There was a bunch of road players in Texas professionals, and I was beating them. I, I was like just fucking on one. My mind was running a mile a minute, and then it ran two miles a minute. And that's when I had a problem. <laugh>, uh, <laugh>. Yeah. I started connecting a lot of things I didn't need. There wasn't really a connection there. Um, I was getting really confused and it was to the point where everything was assemble. I mean, every single object, every person, everything, because everything is a color and all the colors had meaning to me.

Ben (25:32):
Factions. Yeah. I remember,

Mostly Peter (25:35):
Yeah, there was factions and there was like an impending war that I felt was coming. And I remember also like basically having a nervous breakdown about my, just like financial was financial problems and like, just feeling like there was a, just a tangle of problems in my life that were absolutely insurmountable. And I just fucking was, I, I could not, I was paralyzed by I, so watching my cat climb the tree in the yard, good luck to you,

(26:18):
<laugh>.

(26:21):
Uh, yeah. And so I called my Aunt Theresa and I, you know, I was like, needed help and she took me to her boat, but then like disappeared and, or she told me to meet her at her boat and then she wasn't there. And then I like walked back to Ballard from Gasworks and my mind was just fucked up. And then, then they took me to the hospital and they had me self admit and I didn't really understand what I was signing.

Ben (26:50):
Yeah.

Mostly Peter (26:51):
I didn't, I didn't wanna do it. I didn't, I really was not comfortable with what was going on. I tried to make a break for it. The last sec I got my family that my, my uncle and my aunt and my other uncle to help me push this van that was stuck up against a light pole that the driver was needing help. And I was just like, that's a blue van. We're joining Team Blue. This is our last chance to get outta here before Team Gray gets us. Because they, my uncle's car was a gray Tesla and he was taking me to a fucking hospital, which was gray looking, gray vibes and Oh fuck. I was like, this is my last chance to join Team Blue, or I'm fucked. I'm joining Team Gray and that is gonna be off.

Ben (27:34):
And

Mostly Peter (27:35):
You, that is the last thing.

Ben (27:36):
And you wrote two uncles and an aunt into shoving some stranger's van that was stuck against a, a street post of some kind

Mostly Peter (27:44):
Yeah.

Ben (27:45):
To get it in motion. And then

Mostly Peter (27:46):
They fucking got in his van

Ben (27:47):
And the There's a driver. What? There's a driver. The van came to life after you gave it a shove and then you piled in. Did everybody else come with you or you alone?

Mostly Peter (27:55):
No, I, I like piled in. I was like, come on guys, we gotta get outta here. Let's go. And they were like, you're not, well we gotta get back to the hospital. And the guy whose van it was, I'm sure was like, wow, this is something else.

Ben (28:07):
<laugh>. But he was like, I'm the age of destiny. Please pile in, let's go.

Mostly Peter (28:13):
Right. Exactly. Yeah. I remember when I, when I initially ran off, I, I remember looking back at John Paul who was chasing me, and he had this look on his face, like just desperate and hopeless, like eyes wide. He's jogging after me, but he knows he can't catch me. And, and, and I probably won't listen to him and he is scared. Hmm. You know,

Ben (28:37):
This is, you're like sprinting. Are you in underwear at this point or are you clothed?

Mostly Peter (28:41):
Oh, no, no, no. Like I haven't even been admitted yet. I'm wearing regular

Ben (28:44):
Clothes. Okay. Underwear comes later

Mostly Peter (28:46):
And I'm not necessarily sprinting, I'm just like wick running. You know, like one might run if they were really good at running a mile

Ben (28:54):
Plus, like you can hear the person who's, you know, is much slower than you coming and you're like, great, I'll just keep a little buffer and then I'm not catchable. It'll be fine. Yeah.

Mostly Peter (29:03):
Yeah. Anyway, they took me to the hospital, got in there, and then I just absolutely refusal, let 'em take my blood because I thought that they were going to run a diagnostic on my blood, figure out what my glitch was and then use that to make other like, robot people better thought I maybe was a robot or something. Or like in a computer program.

Ben (29:28):
Yeah. So working theory,

Mostly Peter (29:29):
They were gonna just look. Yeah. And they were gonna look at my blood and be like, cool. Like, now we see what went wrong here and I just didn't wanna help the man. I didn't wanna help the fucking gray, gray machine. And I was like, you can't have my blood. And I'm like, I remember thinking like, oh yeah, like that's my blood, that's my property. Like they can't get me. They have to play by team Gray's rules. They have a bunch of rules they have to play by. I'm like out here like fucking sovereign citizen on this shit. I'm not giving them my blood. And they were like, great, so you're not leaving, you're staying here overnight until you fucking give us our blood. You are stuck here, asshole. And I was just like, wait, no, I'll give you my blood and it was too late. It's too late. You

Ben (30:17):
Can have

Mostly Peter (30:17):
My reason left here. I was alone. Yeah.

Ben (30:23):
Restrained.

Mostly Peter (30:24):
Everything was all gear. What's

Ben (30:26):
That? You restrained? Are you sitting on a bed? What's the scene? You in a gurney? Are you in a room with a lockable door? Are you in a padded facility?

Mostly Peter (30:33):
Uh, no. I was, I was in a room on a bed, on a hospital bed. There was no like tubes or anything, no tubes or machines or anything. It's just like a fucking room. They took my clothes, but I refused to give them my underwear and they put me in a gown. Paper gown or, yeah, I think it was paper gown. And they were like, fine, you can keep your underwear. That was their mistake, <laugh>. Um, and I don't even think the door was locked. Maybe I don't think the door was even locked. And then like, I just made a break for it. I don't remember if like somebody had come in to bring me some apple juice or something. I decided that was the moment to run. And I remember just dashing out that door and they were like, wait. And there was like somebody who did the like, arms and legs wide stand in the middle of the hallway thing, Uhhuh. And I just, I gave them like a fucking one ju and they were done for, and I ran outta that joint <laugh>, because most people in the world are not ready to be in a sports, you know, at any given moment.

Ben (31:42):
Yep. Even if you're hired for the job, I guess that's so much the same as you and your Navy gig. It's like, yeah, but if somebody tries to Duke me, what am I gonna stop 'em? Get real. I'm just, I'm just here collecting a paycheck and doing my nine to five. So you're on the street and you're back on the hunt for Team blue. Get me outta here. Where's my van man?

Mostly Peter (32:02):
Kind of, I mean, I was just like, at this point I remember I got outta the hospital and I thought that I had lost a dimension. So I thought that I had essentially downgraded a dimension to where I was the equivalent of like a dog or like some like western animal and no longer had a higher dimension status of like a human. And so that's why I felt walking in my underwear down the street, that people were like looking at me like you would just a straight dog walking down the street. Like, ah, weird. You know, that's unusual, but like whatever. Like it's, they're not part of my dimension. So <laugh>, I'm gonna continue, I'm gonna continue doing my thing, you

Ben (32:48):
Know, I'm not interested in trans dimensional problems. I'm just gonna Steve to be in mind. Leave him well enough alone.

Mostly Peter (32:56):
Yeah. Hang on. I wanna get a cigarette. Hang on a second.

Ben (33:02):
Alright. Where in Seattle are we? Pill Hill.

Mostly Peter (33:11):
Oh no, they took me to the hospital in Ballard

Ben (33:14):
By Yard Hill Hospital.

Mostly Peter (33:17):
Yeah. I don't remember what the name of that joint. Isard Health or whatever. I think it might Ballard in the name.

Ben (33:22):
Um, sunny Day. Think

Mostly Peter (33:24):
It's on market.

Ben (33:25):
What's it look like outside? What did you say? Sunny day grading. What's it look like out there?

Mostly Peter (33:34):
It was August, so it was probably sunny. I think it was sunny. I I wasn't cold. I remember not being cold.

Ben (33:41):
Papery gown making like crumpled. He sounds one of them. Like just a ruckus garment?

Mostly Peter (33:48):
No, I got rid of the gown.

Ben (33:49):
Oh, you got, I went,

Mostly Peter (33:50):
I went for

Ben (33:50):
Just underwear. Was this, were you already in just, just your undies when you took, when you duked security guard man? Or did you lose the paper after you got outside? Yeah,

Mostly Peter (33:58):
I think so. I think I left the gown in the, in the room. Mm.

Ben (34:02):
Like <laugh>, what do I need a

Mostly Peter (34:04):
Paper gown

Ben (34:04):
For? It's, yeah, it's like the, it's the, uh, the boxer's, um, bathrobe or like the sprinter's tracksuit that you were like, all right, I'm ready to perform now. <laugh>, did you strip down to your, uh, actual event garment? I love it.

Mostly Peter (34:18):
<laugh>, my event garment. Yeah. So I'm just walking. You remember I had a problem. I was like, well, I don't have my phone, I don't have my wallet, I don't have my keys, I don't have any of that shit. I don't have any clothes. And so in my head I'm just like trying to kind of like, I'm trying to figure out like, okay, how do I, how do I start from nothing? You know, what do I do?

Ben (34:48):
It's a, you re you reloaded, you respond it.

Ben (00:00):
All right, we're gonna start up again. Great returning. Where, where did it stop? It stopped when you got downgraded into a dog about eight minutes ago.

Peter (00:09):
Oh, fuck,

Ben (00:11):
<laugh>. It's all good. Should I rewind them? No, no, just press on. It's fine. Alright. Your soul was on. So

Peter (00:16):
I'm in the cell, worried about my soul, worried about eternity, and thinking that I, that I basically, uh, I'm halfway dead. Like, I'm basically like, kind of a ethereal, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I've got a water bottle with a little bit of water in it, and I'm thinking, well, that's gone. That's, I'm gone. You know, it's my spirit. So naturally I turned to God and I started praying and stuff, stuff like that, and, and, uh, making promises and so forth.

Ben (00:51):
Like

Peter (00:51):
What? Um, this was after I really tried to break out of this place.

Ben (00:57):
Okay.

Peter (00:57):
Overturned everything. Yeah.

Ben (00:58):
I was gonna say. And

Peter (00:59):
At some point, yeah. I, I made a mess of the place. I was yelling a lot. I just, any like the gurney thing that I was on, I overturned that. And, and then at some point they opened the door. I don't know, maybe before I spazzed like that, probably before I spazzed they opened the door and I tried to make a break for it again. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I remember barreling through a guy who was like, at least 250 pounds. I put him on his ass. And then there was another guy who was like, I will tase you. And I remember like, I was like in full, like, athlete mode, like I'm a football player and I'm going over there to like, this guy pulls out the taser and I just like, deactivated. I was like, ah, all right, I'll go back in there. Like, I <laugh>, like emotion wly, like immediately was like, all right. He went <laugh> and just went back in there. <laugh>. Then they overturned everything. Had all these problems.

Ben (01:59):
What, you said you were making promises to God, like what kind of promises, what do you have to barter with here?

Peter (02:06):
Oh, I think I just was like, like, I basically like promised myself to God so that we could get through the situa, I could get through the situation favorably. Uh, yeah. Anyway, after I overturned everything and made a big mess, I then was like, okay, that's not doing anything. And I tried to set everything in the room as right as I could.

Ben (02:32):
<laugh>. It's like, sorry, those fucking escape the room flash games. You're like, well, I guess I'll just interact with every object in here and see if that helps me escape the room. Nope. Didn't. Okay.

Peter (02:43):
Yeah, exactly. And so I, I fixed up everything. Nice. I grabbed my little food tray and I went around the room and I picked up like every little piece of blin I could find and put it on the tray, just like trying to atone, you know, as best I could, Uhhuh <affirmative>.

(02:59):
And then eventually a guy shows up at the window and he informs me that he is some kind of crisis responder fellow. And, uh, and I was very glad to see another person and that to have another interactable thing that maybe could help me, uhhuh <affirmative>. And I was like, all right, what do you tell me exactly what you want me to do? And he is like, I want you to go lie down on that bed. And I was like, for how long? And he is like, five minutes. And I was like, how long is five minutes <laugh>? I'm getting like, more intense. How long is five minutes? I don't have a clock in here. I don't know what that is. He is like, I, I don't know. I don't know how long. It's five minutes <laugh>. So like, I got him to come up with me <laugh>. Yeah. So I went and, and and laid down. And then I thought I could hear in the next room over like my entire family, like my grandma and grandpa and all my aunts and uncles. And I thought they were like crying and like disgusting how they were gonna have to put me down

Ben (04:07):
Like a dog again.

Peter (04:10):
Again. Yeah. They were gonna have to put me down. And it was real sad. And like, you know, maybe somebody in the family's like, well, isn't there anything else we can do? Well, you know, and it's like that kind of conversation. And so I just made peace with it. I was like, I'm just gonna have to let them kill me because I don't have any other moves at this point. And so I laid down there and I waited to die, and they said they were gonna come in and they came in, six people, they all held me down. They strapped me down to this fucking bed thing. And they pulled out a needle, which I literally thought was a euthanasia. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I thought they were put me down. And I was like, all right, fucking okay, I'm, I'm ready. You know? And they stuck me with it.

(04:58):
And it was just some kind of tranquilizer. And they rolled me out of there and I didn't fall asleep. I remember I stayed conscious and they put me in a, in the ambulance. And I remember like riding the ambulance and there was paramedics back there, or whatever you call those people. And, uh, looking out the back window of the ambulance, I could see my vision was weird because I, I couldn't see any like, limes or textures, but I could see lights, I could see sources of light. So I remember watching the street lights in the back window of the ambulance, almost like they were stars and just riding. And it was very, very nice. Very lovely. So

Ben (05:47):
You've got good drugs kicking at this point, and they're giving you great,

Peter (05:51):
I mean, I'm just watching, I'm watching the stars, I'm like, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, dunno what's going on. Probably like, maybe trying to make with these people and they're just like, shh, it's okay, honey. You know? Yep. And I ended up in Cascade Behavioral and maybe, I don't know, rented or Kent or something. I'd have to look it up. Yep. And, uh, yeah, I was there and right away I'm like trying to figure out how to use the rules again to get out. So I'm like, I

Ben (06:24):
Sovereignty into

Peter (06:25):
My environment. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. I'm sovereign citizen, baby. I'm like carefully reading over the like laws that they have to post on the wall and like taking notes. I got like a pencil and paper. I'm like taking notes. I'm trying to fucking better call, solve my way out of this joint,

Ben (06:41):
You know? Hold up, hold up. You've been released. So you got checked in out the ambulance? Yeah. Into the building. They do some kind of intake process. I'm sure a form gets filled. Yeah. People doc over you. Nobody talks to you except to get like, um, you know, where you are or something like that. And you go, and then you're released in a way where you can walk around and take notes on a piece of paper.

Peter (07:03):
Yeah. It's like a, I don't know, kinda like a college dorm situation. There's like two people to a room, two beds to a room. I don't even, there might have been doors, maybe not, I dunno, probably not. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it's just like a long ass hallway with doors on both sides of it. A center area with like a desk. And then there's another wing on the other side of that.

Ben (07:27):
And there's a person of that desk at all times.

Peter (07:30):
The person at that desk. Yeah. And then there's another way to leave that way, but it's locked. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And there's a sign on that door that says like, be careful of elope. You know, like telling people, like, make sure nobody falls. You have this door. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>.

Ben (07:44):
There's,

Peter (07:45):
I'm,

(07:48):
Um, yeah, I guess like made contact, figured out how to use the telephone. Made contact with like, my mom and Theresa, my mom had flown into Washington from Arizona at this point. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>.

(08:00):
And,

Ben (08:00):
Uh, how, how she had called the Seattle PD to issue the death threat.

Peter (08:05):
Yeah.

Ben (08:08):
Gotcha. Yeah.

Peter (08:10):
Yeah. She said that she was coming. She got there on an airplane. I actually, she visited me in the first hospital, but I think they, I, I don't even remember. Like, it's so fuzzy. You know? I think I was already drugged at that point. That was like before they sent me down to the cascade. And uh, yeah, I was in this fucking place and I was trying to figure out how to legalize my way out of it. And I remember like making like, very like, philosophical arguments with like the guy who was just trying to diagnose me and help me. Mm-Hmm.

Ben (08:48):
<affirmative>

Peter (08:49):
And like painstakingly make him define every term and like, quibble on every word. You know,

Ben (08:58):
<laugh> probably something he deals with often. You know, I gotta imagine people reach for similar tools. I wrote you a letter, I think a couple people did, right?

Peter (09:08):
Yeah. You and Zach and Joe. Yeah. Yeah. I, uh, I don't think I actually got that when I was in. Hmm. I think I, I think I was, I read that when I got out, if I recall. Um, yeah, I got, I got some visits. We go back in Pat. Oh, okay. I got some visits. I was visited by Barry and Tom from the pool hall.

Ben (09:33):
Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>,

Peter (09:34):
Um, uh, John Paul and Gus Theresa and my mother. I don't remember if I had any more. I can't remember very well. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Um, so that was cool. Um, and I could have been in there for three days. I really did not wanna be in there. And I felt like my mind came through. I was like, I'm ready to get outta here. I'm popping these pills. They're telling me to pop the pills. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I'm in there with all, like, some really crazy people. You know, I'm in the no bullshit, like loony joint, some weirdos in there, some guy walking around. Like he walked end to end forever and ever in the halls all day long. He would walk end to end. He had a big beard, old guy, crazy looking. His eye looked like, like he was on meth even though he couldn't have been. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> remember like, I talked to him and he answered me back. I don't remember what the conversation was. I was like, why are you walking? Or something like that. And he like answered me. I guess he had not ever said a word to anybody there. So the staff was like, what did he say to you? <laugh>? You know,

(10:49):
There was another guy like, saw me reading the Bible and he was like, oh, you're trying to solve the millennium puzzle. It'll drive you insane. Because I now laugh at <laugh>

Ben (10:57):
<laugh>.

Peter (11:03):
And I really didn't wanna be there. And my mom and my aunt didn't feel that I was ready to get out. And so they took whatever actions they could to, uh, not let me have my hearing at, at the three day mark. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. They thought I would vomit and then, um, I would have to do the, the two weeks or whatever it was so I could, uh, just get out without a hearing. But I was stuck there for like two weeks and I really hated it. I did get switched to the suicidal wing, which was better 'cause I was just like, get me away from these people. Like, I don't, this is not helpful, you know? And so they transferred me to another wing and from there it got a little better. There was a computer that I could use. I, I got on Facebook and was able to message a couple people and, and the computer went away and <laugh>

Ben (11:58):
Where, um, we're like August now. Something like that.

Peter (12:04):
Yeah. Yeah. I think I got out September 11th or call.

Ben (12:08):
Okay. I came and saw you not too long after that. I don't remember when though. Yeah. But you were still on, or Actually when I saw you, well, this is jumping ahead, but I remember we went back, we went back to, fuck, what's it called? What are they called? The hospital for veterans. The va. The va. You went back to the VA because you had a relationship already with one of the psych people there to get some other script filled.

Peter (12:34):
Yeah. But yeah, that was sketchy.

Ben (12:38):
What was getting out. Yeah.

Peter (12:39):
That

(12:41):
What, two

Ben (12:41):
Weeks? Two weeks you're in there, switched to the suicide wing, some computer, the computer gets taken away. You're ostensibly in a room without a door for that, for that experience. That makes it sound like a room without a door is misleading. It sounds like the opposite of what it is. That sounds like a closed space when it's in fact a decidedly unclos space. Anyway. Um, yeah. What was getting out? Who picks you up?

Peter (13:14):
Joe came to pick me up. Yeah. He, he, he never did visit me when I was in there and he felt bad, so he came to pick me up.

Ben (13:25):
Rud picked up to school,

Peter (13:26):
Didn't he? What

Ben (13:28):
Little red pickup?

Peter (13:30):
No, I think he had his money truck by then.

Ben (13:33):
Big red pickup.

Peter (13:35):
Yeah.

Ben (13:36):
From, from,

Peter (13:38):
Yeah. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> would've been so much nicer if it was a little red pickup.

Ben (13:42):
Yep. That thing still would feel like home if I climbed in it.

Peter (13:46):
Yeah. Agreed. Yeah. And then we just went up to, uh, to Ballard and I got myself a pack of cigarettes and a beer.

Ben (14:00):
That must have a good fucking cigarette.

Peter (14:03):
It was a good cigarette. <laugh>. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They say cigarettes are good for schizophrenic people. And I at the time thought that I maybe was bad. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. You know? I know. I don't think so. I think I just was doing drugs.

Ben (14:20):
You'd broken some, um, um, did you move back in with John Paul? You returned to that digs?

Peter (14:29):
Yeah, I did. I did briefly. Yeah. I did for a little, a little bit. Yeah. 'cause I was there until about April and then we moved to New Orleans. Yeah. Yeah. I got a job at a, I obviously lost my job at Sam's, but I got a job at a different club downtown. You.

Ben (14:48):
Well also there's a stretch where you're doing fucking lawn work. You were like driving a fucking sit mower.

Peter (14:56):
Yeah. That was before, um, that was before, that was the summer. Ah, I was working for Tom. I was working for Tom.

Ben (15:03):
Right.

Peter (15:04):
That was when I left, when I left school, I was like, I still want more income. So I went and took a second job for Tom. Got it. Doing lawn work. Yeah. Actually, I remember, I, you know, right when I got outta the hospital, I, I got off my drugs and stopped taking them. You have to take 'em when you're in. And then I had like a relapse kind of with my mind, because you're not supposed to just pull Turkey. Those things supposed to wean. And, uh,

Ben (15:32):
I think that's when I helped you get a fill back, get your script filled back, didn't it?

Peter (15:37):
Well, well, I, I remember I like, I went off of 'em and I went crazy again. Kind of. I remember I went to the pool hall and it was like the last, one of the last days it was open, maybe the last day it was open. And uh, I remember one of the guys, I, one of the superior players named Free Ron, and I told him I was quitting pool. And I remember he like cried. He was like sobbing and telling me that, that I had so much talent and I shouldn't quit pool. And it was such a weird fucking vibe. And I was like, this is just too much <laugh>. Like, why is this dude sobbing? Like, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Why is this pool hall closing today again, like, just like, what is the meaning of this kind of shit? Tom followed me back in his car, followed me back to my apartment and make sure I was all, because you could see that I was having a hard time still.

Ben (16:27):
Tom played pool. Tom was one of your pool buddies.

Peter (16:30):
Yeah, Tom, Tom played pool and I also worked for him and he was, uh, he was the best, he was the best one in Seattle.

Ben (16:39):
The best pool player.

Peter (16:41):
Yeah.

Ben (16:42):
Gotcha.

Peter (16:44):
Yeah. And, uh, so yeah, obviously I looked up to him too, you know.

Ben (16:50):
Are you still in touch with Tom or is he outta the picture?

Peter (16:54):
No, I haven't talked to Tom. I actually, he came down here I think, to get something for his van. And uh, we met up, but that was like 20, 20, 21 I guess. Mm. The last time I had seen him or talked to him.

Ben (17:08):
Covid days in the barracks.

Peter (17:14):
It was, yeah, I mean, it's covid, but like late enough that it was, you know, you could go places.

Ben (17:21):
Not, not barracks. I don't know what

Peter (17:22):
You're talking about.

Ben (17:22):
Barracks. Oh, uh, the barracks is what I, I don't even know why, but I have that word associated with the group. The Hutt, the, the packed in no pre hutt group packed in homeless shelter for vets.

Peter (17:34):
I think that was probably in the hut by then.

Ben (17:37):
That Hutt was fucking lit. No. Cool. Hutt what? Cool Hutt.

Peter (17:43):
Yeah. I like the Hutt.

Ben (17:45):
Yeah. It was a good hut.

Peter (17:49):
Go ahead. Uh, anyway, I, I, I fucking got basically just shoved onto a plane down to Arizona right when I, when I had that like mental relapse thing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. That was a weird experience flying while your brain isn't working.

Ben (18:06):
Oh yeah. And then you stayed with your mom for a stretch

Peter (18:10):
For like, less than a week. And I busted outta there. I helped and I was terrified

Ben (18:14):
Of her. That one I helped you on, that was one where I was like, okay, you need to take it. Fine. Get out. I remember that. You were like, I gotta go down there. And you went down and then you were like, there's a man coming here. I need to go. Zach picked you up or something. Gave you a ride to flag.

Peter (18:30):
I'd say Patrick picked me up and took me down to, to Phoenix and I stayed with him for a few days till my flight. Yep. Yep. And then I, and then I went to Joe's parents' place.

Ben (18:41):
Yep. It

Peter (18:42):
Was like an emer it was an emergency. Like I was not, I could not be there. I could not,

Ben (18:50):
I remember that. That was spooky.

Peter (18:53):
Yeah. That was very bad. I, yeah. I used every piece of my willpower to get away from that place.

Ben (19:05):
And then you got back to Seattle

Peter (19:08):
Again? I got back to Seattle, got the job at the club and I got a job at some diner, some like swanky ass

Ben (19:19):
Wow. Brunch joint on the hill. Love that. Do you remember the name or the street?

Peter (19:25):
No, I could figure it out, but no, I don't remember. Uh, street. No, I don't know. I don't know the name of that place. It seems like it was pretty far south on the hill. I'm blanking. Alright. Yeah, I remember I was like, I, I immediately hit the hit the hit the street just trying to get a job. I was just like, literally going door to door saying,

Ben (19:58):
Mm-Hmm.

Peter (19:59):
<affirmative>. Do you, do you know anywhere that might be hiring? Do you know anything about anyone getting any jobs at any time at all? And just following every lead all day long. And so I got a job which took like days and it was like free covid, Seattle. It was not easy to get hired at that time. Yeah. Ultimately I got, I got a job because I happened to run into a manager at this place and I fucked her for a job. She didn't know that, but that's what happened.

Ben (20:31):
What was the, that was the downtown one Dreamgirls or something like it?

Peter (20:37):
No, no, no, no, no. That was the diner. I'm talking about the diner.

Ben (20:40):
Oh, got it, got it. Got

Peter (20:41):
It. That's how I got that job, Dreamgirls. I just went in there and was like, I already have a manager's license. I know this job.

Ben (20:47):
Got it. And they and I work here love having that happen.

Peter (20:52):
Yeah. They were like, that's great. I can't believe you would be so dumb. I just try to stay in this industry. Yeah.

Ben (21:00):
Um, now it's fall winter 2018 into 2019. Oh

Peter (21:15):
Yeah. Yeah. It's winter, fall, winter, that's right.

Ben (21:23):
Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>.

Peter (21:25):
And then you were like, Hey, you wanna move to Orleans? And I was like, yep.

Ben (21:32):
I think that'll pretty much do it. How do you feel about the choice to move to New Orleans? Are you glad you did?

Peter (21:39):
Definitely, yeah. I just wish I would, would've handled it better.

Ben (21:45):
<laugh> in my head. It's like New Orleans was a pretty brutal cocktail for Peter, but the real reason it was never gonna work out is 'cause the summers are too hot. He just couldn't take the heat. It is just those goddamn hot summers boil them.

Peter (22:06):
I don't even know. What are you, what are you saying? I can't tell. What's the joke and what's the real,

Ben (22:12):
It's, there's not really a joke here. It's an earnest, it's an earnest thought in my head. So it's funny to me that that's what my brain attaches. Like why it didn't pan instead of like drugs problems and, and et cetera. I'm like, the real reason it was never gonna pan out is 'cause it gets hot in the summer. 'cause I just remember I have such a clear image of you stepping outside when you were living with me and Tyler and Stewart. Although really it was me and Tyler or whatever. Neither of them really were presences, but you stepping out and being like, it's fucking radioactive out here. And I was like, man, there's nothing, you know, you can, you can shift a lot of things about how you live in a place, but if the weather, if you can't hang with the weather, that's kind of it. And I, I, I still ascribe a lot of the woe to that even though like, you know, slightly more life-threatening problems arose than sunburn.

Peter (23:07):
Yeah, I think that's true. I mean, maybe I could have figured out how to I survived at once, you know. Yeah. But, uh,

Ben (23:15):
Night creature. Yeah. Night, night creature. New Orleans is pretty cool though. Viking around there at night was, that's special.

Peter (23:21):
Yeah, that's true. I'm definitely glad I went though. Super. Yeah, no that's definitely a good, that was a good, I love the diversity that added to my life experience portfolio. <laugh>.

Ben (23:41):
And that's why, that's why I believe I'm the right candidate. Um, yeah. I tried to recapitulate, I needed to tell somebody I about, I love Mustard because they said I love, that's a tough one. They said I love and they said a different word after and I was like, oh, you're the kind of friend who needs to know about this is my friend Caleb. You need to know about I love Mustard. And then I realized to tell that story, I would need to talk for about an hour just to get to I love Mustard. I was like, what a fucking day here. I need to explain. I love Mustard and I have to start with, wait, no, I have to start with Wait, no, I actually have to start with ah, shit. Okay. So Peter had not slept 'cause he'd been playing pool, but I woke up and pretty soon we're both naked except for the Coleman rain jackets that we're wearing and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Peter (24:28):
<laugh>. Just no reason not to tell the story. But, uh, I don't, I don't actually still know why I love Mustard is even

Ben (24:37):
ERs. Oh, I got you. I it's

Peter (24:38):
Just,

Ben (24:41):
I could explain. Okay. I could explain comedy. Um, okay. <laugh>, do you remember the premise, the setup for it?

Peter (24:48):
We were at like Denny's, I think

Ben (24:50):
That's half of it. The other half is the question, would you rather have ketchup on a strawberry or mustard on a banana <laugh>? And I took your question seriously. Meanwhile, you were lathering some kind of goop from a bottle on the table that was lukewarm onto some other hot food applying, you know, warm flavored hot food. And I answered and I was like, well, strawberries are kind of sweet, ketchup's kind of sweet. There's a, a shred of harmony there. Whereas I think it's just flash with mustard and banana. And I look up and you haven't even lifted your eyes. You're just kinda like happily going back and forth with a butter knife doing whatever to whatever. And you just go, I love mustard. And you had had no interest whatsoever in like, actually you just did. You just wanted to tell me that you love mustard. It wasn't a question. <laugh>. You were rolling out your own carpet. Yeah,

Peter (25:47):
I love busters,

Ben (25:49):
But I just died. I also like, you know, I had no defenses left by that

Peter (25:55):
Time <laugh>. That's right. I forgot about the, the, would you rather question that proceeded?

Ben (26:00):
Yeah. I love mustard. Yep.

Peter (26:09):
Oh,

Ben (26:12):
I need to, I need to pull the plug in the storytelling. 'cause I don't think I have it in me to transcribe two hours of voice memo.

Peter (26:19):
Yeah, fair

Ben (26:20):
Enough.

Peter (26:21):
Yeah, that was, it's hard, it's hard to tell that because it's just hard to remember everything and there's lots of shit going on at once. Kind of.

Ben (26:30):
Yeah. There's a line I think, I think from Caleb, but in reflection on some piece that we'd all read together for the fucking same class that we're now talking, I live with a person with whom I have this class that I, that we're now conducting an interview for,

Peter (26:47):
Ah,

Ben (26:48):
Uhhuh <affirmative>. And he said something about a piece we'd read from Wg sled. Caleb said something like, blah blah, blah, the destructive quality towards memory of talking about it or some shit. It was something about like, the way that we talk about or remember these things destroys them. And I was like, but isn't remembering stuff like the only way that you could isn't talking about isn't accessing memories no matter what you do with them, the only way that you preserve them. 'cause if they're never accessed, then they're gone. Yeah. Which this funny thing where his contention was like, I mean they

Peter (27:21):
Still exist in your subconscious

Ben (27:23):
Right. But see you, you see what I'm, you see what I'm going for? It was like to, to handle 'em is to destroy them, but then also paradoxically to handle 'em as the only way in which they exist outside of oblivion.

Peter (27:38):
Yeah. I don't think destroy, I think distort. Yeah.

Ben (27:40):
Yeah.

Peter (27:42):
You know, like anytime you're telling a memory, you're gonna distort it, but if you don't tell it, there's nothing to distort. Yeah.

Ben (27:52):
That thing that, that that old chestnut has Jordan likes to quip. That's a pretty good one. I see you're still Jesus.

Peter (28:05):
Yeah. I got rid of my beer though.

Ben (28:07):
<laugh> Now you're like hip Jesus stylist styling Jesus.

Peter (28:12):
Yeah.

Ben (28:13):
Which time's Jesus.

Peter (28:14):
Yeah. My hair is, my hair is long as fuck, man. It comes down my shoulder down to my fucking collarbone. I guess

Ben (28:23):
When you were telling the more stressful parts of your story, including, um, uh, entrusting your, you know, your soul to God and stuff you kept grabbing at your hair and pulling it across your, uh, across your chin became Oh really? Like worry beads. Yeah.

Peter (28:42):
<laugh>. I didn't know that.

Ben (28:44):
It's funny. It's a new habit. It has to be new 'cause you've not had hair long enough for it to be a habit before.

Peter (28:50):
Yeah, that's right.

Ben (28:52):
Yeah, that's right.

Peter (28:53):
I'm growing a, growing a new habit.

Ben (28:56):
That's also funny. A habit in keeping with entrusting yourself to God, you've put on your habit. Um, which is a fashion joke. I don't know if you're hit that. That's what monks wear. They wear habits. Um, and for the last feather in your cap in the cowl of your habit, um, my house is embraced. I understand It has become common parlance in my home, which is pretty fun.

Peter (29:21):
Fantastic. It's just, you know, if I go out, split it on the grave out it.

Ben (29:30):
Yep. That's pretty, um, pretty cox gravestone. Peter. I understand.

Peter (29:43):
<laugh> <laugh>. Yeah. That sounds good. Okay. Don't do that. I guess what I mean is that's gotta be one of the things that I contributed.

Ben (29:51):
I understand.

Peter (29:54):
Very cool. All right, well I'm gonna go inside terminate. I'm gonna terminate and go inside.

Ben (30:06):
Thanks for sharing your story.

Peter (30:09):
Yeah, man. I hope that's usable.

Ben (30:12):
I'll use it. Oh, I'm going to use it. I am gonna use it also, I think, and this thought occurred before bef well before I picked up the phone to ring you some days ago, I was like, oh, I should also do this with Jamil, get him on the horn and just have him rattle off a story and write it down. And then I was like, but I only need one for my assignment. I was like, yeah, but I just want to do this with you want it What? <laugh>? I was like, assignment. Wait, that's, I'm forgetting what I'm doing. I'm not doing an assignment. Yeah. I'm talking to people I care about. That's what I wanna do.

Peter (30:45):
Yeah. You could do a bunch. You do a bunch by all that. Yeah.

Ben (30:50):
All right. Love you. Have a good night.

Peter (30:53):
All right. Love you Ben. You have.
