I met someone who activated me.
Who brought me great treasures.
Bathed me in treasures
Briskly, a vigorous scrubbing down

Tingle, prickle, a bit raw, step out
Those reluctant feelings, that would prefer to remain sequestered and paved over by highways of throughput[!] a good march. Feelings like little crabs that are so intent on hiding for safety
Reaching back out

The sick revulsion, with self, with world beyond, with accuser, with surroundings. A propagating bitterness. Then, so soon, the smug satisfaction of being good, of doing good, tainted still with so much desire for self. A propagating bitterness?

Stirring, activating, launching. Ing Ing Ing Ing.
Moments to draw from:
Lunging up the staircase, having caught sight of her while she waits for the elevator, knowing that we'll intersect at the top.
A stroke, a spark catching, hem and haw to enter the building, but then the terrible good fortune of being happened upon.
