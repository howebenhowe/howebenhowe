## Peter

We already ate all the best cherries. We'd been gobbling them up for weeks, well before they were properly ripe. It's a Royal Anne cherry tree. They start small and green, just a bitter skin wrapped around the pit, and then they fatten until they are thickly yellow with blotches and blushes of red. The red ones we can get to from our tree house are gone though, and today is our last chance to pick before we head out on our Big Trip East to see Mom's uncle and a whole bunch of people she keeps mentioning and we keep forgetting. But we've already packed, and so mom said we could pick cherries for the road while they load the car.

The tree is eighty years old. It might still be growing a little, but it's already a big tree. An adult. The lowest branches, the oldest ones, reach out overhead from the trunk, and the tree house our dad built sits pretty flat in that first forking crown. Ben goes first, scrambling up the rope ladder and onto the platform. His feet are black on the bottom, stained from a summer unshod. I'm up after him, and we survey the branches for cherries. None in easy reach, but tempting clusters of five and eight bob on twigs further out. I climb over the treehouse railing and lower my belly to the bough. Even while crawling, every shift of my weight sends a shiver through the nearest leaves. The bark under my fingers is so smooth it shines except where scabby fissures in the bark break it up. I move my hands and feet one at a time, making slow progress. Ben says something behind me, but I can't hear him. I lift up a bit on my arms and start to turn toward him, but my hand slips and suddenly I'm falling. My arms are out and there's rocks, but then it's loud and bright and hot and I'm yelling, my head hurts, it hurts it hurts.

## Kate (We're on a tight schedule: Peter calls for help: worry about my baby: he's okay no concussion: hit the road with bigs in the front)

The car was already packed. We were set to leave, for Indiana, the reunion was set for July. Plan was we'd drive by way of the Jane and Michael Stern book, *Road Food*. Many places to eat, see the world's biggest rubber band. Plus the man who made concrete sculptures and had entombed his wife in his back yard, Sam Dinsmoor. Then the front door slammed and Ben was yelling "Peter fell on his head".
I ran out at flank speed; I needed to find my baby, what happened to him. There he was at the base of the tree, sitting and blinking pie-eyed. Ah christ, he's had a concussion. The goose egg was already forming. Did we need to take him to the hospital? I asked him some questions. Show me where it hurts.
I'm okay, I'm okay, he kep saying--the original stoic. Meanwhile, Dan was riding herd on the other three, getting them into the car and buckled. It didn't seem like a concussion. After you came and got me, I can't remember what you were doing. Floating in the background.

## Me

"I mostly remember sudden panic caught up in my throat. You climbed out on that branch and fell--I can see the tree and the ladder, but maybe not from that day. I can't remember if you went up first." I say.
It's two in the morning and Peter's packing for a train that leaves in four hours. The train will take him to Seattle to see our parents. He can't remember much from that day either: his arms outstretched, rocks rushing up, the sky. 
Time wore away the details, mixed the images from that day with the other stories we share. A couple parts were durable enough to resist erosion. Sick white blazing, an egg shaped tension in my throat, a possible wrongness in the world pressing to be born, my own voice ringing alone.

## ben perspective
My own perspective. I'm climbing a tree with peter. We are both of us operating in parallel. We're scarfing tasty cherries. Our feet are rough. The branches bounce under our weight with each step. We have previously eaten all the accessible cherries--we've though there are cherries all across the tree that are ripening and going to eventually be ripe, our appetite for them has outstripped the daily bounty from the low and accessible branches. Use some foreshadowing, have described the area below the tree including the large stones in the garden retaining wall. The branches stretched in each direction, some back toward the back of the property, a few toward the street. The tree sandwiched between the houses. I'm reaching elsewhere for a cherry, I had been hearing the sounds of another, my counterpart, the parallel cherry picker. Then sick silence. In memory (should I reveal I'm sitting here, remembering?) it's whited out by the absence of sound. I hear the soft sound of a small body hitting the ground. There's a stretch when I'm quiet, but hurrying. The sharper fidelity of seses, fingers reporting the rigid frills at the edge of every bark scab. I go to Peter and yell. I run inside to get my parents. Just below my neck there's an egg of tension, possible wrongness in the world pressing to be born throuh my mind. The silence where my brother's voice should be. My ears ring with my own voice, though somehow I can hear the solid cast brass lever hitting the bottom of its range, the heavy thunk of it, the weight of the door swinging open. Abruptly, I become a cloud around the activity that is actualy playing out. Total nubness where my fingers had been raised to the height of their power. I dfloat quietly at the periphery. I can't think what or if I should say anything.

slithered along my belly, scoot scoot scoot. Lost my balance fell off, probably headfirst. Fell eight feet, ten feet. Small pile of stones there, partly caugh tmyself with my arms but definitely bashed head. Can't remember the rest well, rushed inside to the TV room. Ice pack on the head, looking out the front windows from a low angle. After that, bits and pieces of the story after that, as told by mom and dad.
remember picking blood out of the hair a little later. Telling kids about it in first grade or so. No feeling of swimming in open ocean, just a little slither. 
a feeling of "this is the last chance, gotta pick 'em all" to it. 


# notes

## mom interview
There was no blood

### irrelevant

Lots of snakes on the road, no cell phones, went down to a swamp bumpity bump, bugs bugs bugs, dad says "come camp", hell naw, we all get back in. "This was kansas, I think" We were by a big metal warehouse with glaring white lights. Lots of toads came prompting me to shout "the rocks are moving".

### relevant

we were on a tight schedule
"ah christ, he's had a concussion. looking at his goose egg, worried about a hospital.

Ben came and shouted "peter fell on his head"
kate ran at flank speed, got to get to my baby and find out what happened to him.
Found him at the base of the tree. Sitting there wide eyed, blinking.
Ask him some questions, show where it hurt. He was the original stoic. "I'm okay, I'm okay." he said.
Should we put some ice on it? We're gonna leave in 10 minutes. Meanwhile, we (kate and dan) were riding herd on the rest of us.
Once 4 kids buckled, private conference with Dan about whether to take to hospital, determined we knew signs of concussion well enough.
Ben floating around in the background, not focused.
Two bigs in the bigger bench seat in the back.
You two farquars in middle bench to keep an eye on Peter.

## dad interview

"How'd you feel when I told you?" "Very worried. Throw in a little internal guilt. If I'd only been watching him."

Sophie still alive at the time? "I think George and Gail kept her."

How would Dan have felt?
"Would not have panicked, having enough years behind me with kids -- that could lead to a lot of different things. I'm sure I dropped what I was doing, ran out to see. Probably feeling frightened on a certain level for my kid, but also, this may be nothing. Gotta see either way. Ice right away, initial instinct. Don't remember the incident, don't remember rushing out. Overall, probably feeling like there's no need for emergency care, we could get underway. We weren't super hovering parents, rushing you off to the emergency room. 

You two had a bond that I may never understand, but that might be the moment that the aware
