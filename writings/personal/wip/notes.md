I wonder at the dream-weaver. His workbench is 

Dream fragments. The emptied shells washed up on the shore.
I slept knowing I wanted to write about my dream. I dreamt in pieces of thought about writincg. A cone of light, warm edged and wide-splayed, shone into my blackly unconscious mind. Retreated down the length, my alarm clock likewise pressed into consciousness. It didn't make any sound, but its image shone clearly, its impression impinged on the abyssal basis of sleep, a form asserting itself into formlessness. The warmth could have been my duvet it's flannel cover, or the sweatshirt I wore to bed. That cone of light might have been the automatic glow that my alarm clock produces for minutes before it rings. The fragments could be sourced from stimuli of my waking mind, but I think they are more inspiration.
