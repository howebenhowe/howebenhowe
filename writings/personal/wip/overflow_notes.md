# Word soup
overflow - undermine - breach - subvert boundary - fragment - facet - scope - punctuation - semantic unit - inhabited shell emptied - defamiliarization shatters a shell - meaning liberated from word corpse - a free magic - unstable - collapsing - communion - active - awake - discrete language units - as long as we are moving without noticing the strangeness, things are well confined to their pat definitions, they aren't spilling over - the poet writes an experience, communion, in response to prompt in their life -> propagating not just beauty, but the spilling over which is beauty's operating mechanism - beauty as chain of 'bestest ever' (see notes) -> takes you back to earliest version of the thing you experience with significance, the thing before it was caged - we imbue 'beautiful' objects of our observation with the quality of life by thinking them beautiful -> that which spills over is no longer the dead thing in the shell/the numbness, but the living thing, the thing alive because of our nociting of it.

# Structure/thesis/it gets written here

Poetry is in the game of construing then subverting the encapsulation of meaning by word, phrase, and even line -- never know when to trust it, so you're ever present on thin ice.

Schklovsky on image: defamiliarization gets you to notice
Scarry on beauty: always the particular then dislodges you
Eagleton on imagination: 

# quotations/sources
+ each affirms the aliveness of the other...What has been raised is not the level of aliveness, which is already absolute, but ones own access to the already existing level of aliveness -> beauty is the overflow of meaning from the word-bound version (scarry ~856)
+ the chain of best-ever (nausicaa and the tree and odysseus) (scarry ~something)


Poetry ruptures the standard encapsulation of meaning (using its man tools) 

## Schklovsky
defamiliarization (incl. rhythm disorder)
focused on the image, but also the word can be defamiliarized

## Eagan
+ Plato kicks off the idea that imagination needs to be broken and yoked to serve reason; we gotta control our diet of thought in order to head toward truth -> he's all for binding words to precise definition in order to build solid structures (enter political distrust of beauty)
+ Plato: reason can know truth, imagination just mimics
+ Augustine: don't trust images 
+ Graham: catholic communion is where it's at; the cerebral-only version is lame
+ wordsworth + other romantics argue getting older makes us dull, imagination tries to recapture childhood purity 

History is a Burning Chariot
by Charles Wright

It is a good-looking evening, stomped and chained.
The clouds sit like majesties in their blue chairs,
    As though doing their nails
The creek, tripartite and unreserved, sniddles along
Under its bald and blown-down bridges.
It is a grace to be a watcher on such a scene.
So balance me with these words -
Have I said them before, I have,
    have I said them the same way, I have,
Will i say them again, who knows
        What darkness snips at our hearts.

I've done the full moon, I've done the half moon and the
	quarter moon.
I've even done the Patrick Spens moon
As seen by one of his drowned sailors.
Tonight is the full moon again, and I won't watch it.
These things have a starting place, and they have an ending.
Render the balance, Lord.
         Send it back up to the beginning.

evening is "stomped and chained" incongruent adjectives and nouns
the creek 'sniddles' - improvised onomatopoeia
clouds sit in thrones - incongruent nouns and verbs by way of anthropormorphising
3rd line is right-shifted, setting a different tone for the line in company with its petty content
the creek is posessor of the bridges which cross it
suddenly direct address from the speaker
question marks are absent, commas instead, refiguring of punctuation
reference to Spens bridges out from confines of only its own context
nails at odds with majesty -> adjacency of conflicting tones dislodge language from one interpretation

by breaking the confines of a word, we lose our certainty that things will stay where they 'belong', and so we lose our own footing, lost to see like one of Jack Spicer's otters
# Overflow

Poets' tools rupture. By overloading meaning in a word, by making images unfamiliar, by manipulating breath and rhythm, they crack open the shell of a word, phrase, sentence, story and rewild the captive meaning, inducing us to communion. Scarry calls attention to this with her assertion that beauty only occurs in the particular. What is true of beauty, though, is true of every other impression we feel. Scarry isn't interested in the general, as she was primarily focused on the dumpster diving redemption of beauty from philosophy's waste. Still, her point is well made--we don't think palm trees are beautiful until we've met with a specific beautiful palm tree. Likewise we don't think of (general negative thing) as (generally negative), but rather remember a particular instance of that (negative thing). With an image, per Schklovsky, it's defamiliarization. When it's beauty they have produced in the audience, beauty as Scarry's life-giving mutual affirmation, the reader is made aware of the universe in which they aren't even the center.

How has it affected me?
I'm having a harder and harder time discerning the separation of disciplines. The 'Scope' and 'Facet' data models of my daily software labor won't stay in their 9-5 corral, and stow away with me into poetry class. My housemate's insistence that she teach me to play an instrument of my choosing is laced with irresistable exhortation from Jorie Graham to walk about your home sniffing the better to awaken your soul. Sitting in a Google Store waiting for my phone's touch screen to be fixed, the capacitive face of , reading from Aimé Césaire's Notebook of a Return to the Native Land, I find a 

“And above all, my body as well as my soul, beware of assuming the sterile attitude of a spectator, for life is not a spectacle, a sea of miseries is not a proscenium, a man screaming is not a dancing bear…” (45)

In poetry, poets do the Schklovsky thing of defamiliarizing to bring about the scarry thing of the particular. This process is the sundering of encapsulation (see techniques that break the more rigid functions of language) which both frees the meaning and engages the audience, those two things describing a communion.

If you bend word meaning with the intent of breaking the meaning free, you have to simultaneously maintain the presence of the shell while moving away from it. Compare with a physical object: if you want to break open the shell of a nut, you just have to apply changing force until it gives way and you have shattered pieces in your hands. The physical evidence, the pieces of shell, are all you need to remember that there was a shape that is now broken. With language, there is no such physical residue, so when we demand that the word blackberry become also an elegy--that is, when we go about breaking the word from it's automatic function--we have to maintain it's former state as we break it; maintain the image of what came before as it is broken into what comes after. The word 'blackberry' is still a fruit in a bramble in a memory, given a place among oth
