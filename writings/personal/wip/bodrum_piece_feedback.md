# Bodrum Piece Feedback

+ "I hope  it's about pirates" - charlie
+ credit card worry from nina
+ "Capitan" and "Hero" are derailing for stephanie and aryn
+ They dig the 'fraternal silent alarm system'
+ Margot: you don't get to see what the first person is thinking, like "'Capitan', I thought", which leaves more up to interpretation -- which gets in the way in the written format of a spoken story
+ Charlie: could do more foreshadowing, building of suspense, getting more claustrophobia going earlier
+ sasha digs the pacing, plunged into the story, brisk clip across the moments
+ aryn: indicate explicitly in a moment or two the trepidation
+ madeline: the tonal shift creeps up on you, you don't notice that things that are off are happeninng, you notice too late...is that a plus? Withhold the foreshadow?
+ give the brothers some presence in the story -- helps contextualize the experience across more perspectives
+ margot, lacking visual context -- clean, dirty, crowded, waves, still, dark
+ margot/madeline: brothers are interchangeable. Need to work in their attitudes/distinctive qualities into the story
+ Mad: extending sympathy for being shackled to memory/truth
+ Steph: what's the significance of using 'we brothers' multiple times?
+ charlie: if you're building suspense, bringing us there is critical. You have to smell, feel, hear it. The right details to activate our senses can help to bring us with you. You don't want us sitting back, looking at a travelogue if you want us to be in this scenario with you. Create the senses. Engage the senses. I only describe visually. What's the smell, feel of the boat?
+ Ian: give me a location, damnit.

ben: the translation of a story I've told verbally to a written context is tricky! It's not obvious what's going to drop out as it makes the switch
