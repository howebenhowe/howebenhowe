# My Father's Belt
after Linda Gregg

My father's belt, my belt
frays slowly even as it separates
along a seam of strain.
Come down from your tree. Already my patience
burnt for fuel, and I'm leaving at 300 mph.
In rain we laughed and listened, giddy to share a storm
and wriggling as after a bath and the perfect contentment
of finding anything new
we look in, but the windows are shrouded by the canopy.
Inscrutable greeting in morse code from a million lantern operators
leapt from windy gesture
releasing pieces of light by an infinite design
Almost free again to, what, feel? Despond?
A tunnel to cream orange sky, probably somewhere over
Jersey,
but never mind that.
