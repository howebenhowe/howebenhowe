# Sam Hug

Sam texts me that they just arrived to the Neptune bar. I head out of the murky red lighting and raucous Cajun fiddle music to the street. Hooking right out the door, I see Sam.

Sam's glasses are broken on one side, missing the left temple. They applied a dab of soldering and spare high-gauge copper wire to keep the glasses in service, and the fix has lasted more than two years. Tonight Sam decided to wear a long black leather trench coat. I don't know what else they are wearing; nothing else could register. Their hair is long, and frizzy. Shallow waves run through it, down their back over their broad, leather-wrapped shoulders. If they embraced a regimen of shampoo and arghan oil I'm sure their hair would be ready for the big screen. Sam doesn't keep many particular regimens.

They are bouncing an orange lacrosse ball when I greet them. Their eyes are clear and bright under the street lamps. Their focus is keen. Sam smiles when they see me, drops the ball into an abyssal pocket, and walks toward me arms wide. We embrace and it lasts. I savor the generous pressure of their arms around my back. When we draw apart I see Sam's grin has broadened. Their cheeks have patchy, coarse whiskers.
