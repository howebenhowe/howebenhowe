# Tea

I tried breaking, and winced. The tip glanced of the cue ball with a wooden clang which quickly drowned in the din of hair metal. The ball proceeded stupidly down the table, but Harris plucked it from the green before it could stumble into the neat triangle at the other end. He walked round to the head of the table and I found myself displaced. 

"Still fucked up?" he asked loudly. I had leaned the cue against the table rail and was massaging my wrist.

"Yeah. PT today though--they had me dunking my arm up to here in hot wax until I was thickly glazed. My hand was sweating inside a wax sock. Weird sensation. Then when they pull--" the crack of Harris's breaking stroke cut me off, made me jump, sent my cue sliding toward the floor. Balls scattered in terror across the table, the 2-ball burrows into a side pocket. 

"Nice break. Anyway, it was like having a new hand birthed from some alien sac. My skin was supple." I said, leaning my cue safely against trash cabinet.

"Gross, dude." *Crack* The corner pocket sucked the 6-ball down greedily. Harris circled the table, considering his next object while the table reported the clockwork descent of his last. "Speaking births, I ever tell you about Kooser?"

"Navy?" I asked, "He has a kid now? That can't have been on purpose. Didn't he let those puppies die?" I sat at the bar adjacent and picked up my beer. 

"No--I mean yes the puppies are dead--but no, the time he lost it--" a patient movement of his arm this time, the cue steady, the cue ball struck the 7 then pulled backwards a food before arresting. Harris speaks up over the tumbling ball in the table.

"--lost it and checked into the hospital?" He finished. He glanced up from his study of the table at me, eyebrows arched. Then back down. He squeaked chalk on the cue tip. "This was right after he got out. Sold his vacation back to the Navy." He paused for a second and held up his thumb and finger a couple inches apart. "When you leave you get this fucking folder and it has like, uh, I don't know, two dozen, maybe 30 signatures that you need from various people who are responsible for various specific things. And since they only have one fucking thing they look after, they are very serious about that. So you're like, okay, I need to go convince this person that I am absolutely squeaky clean in their particular department. And then just do that over and over and over and over and over, over with all these like fucking officious clerks that are wearing camouflage for some reason."

"Oh, didn't notice you there."

"Yeah. And he actually had a pretty serious problem because he had had his car broken into maybe like six months prior, and all of his many thousands of dollars of like armor and CBRN gear, just like chemical, biological, radiological, neurological protection gear, shit that just stays sealed in a bag. But you would never, ever use ever, ever, ever. And even if you need to, you would die before you figured out how to unseal the bag. Just a huge camo duffle that we all had to bring around with us to all our posts just because it was on a piece of paper somewhere that we had to have that. And it literally just served as a pillow. That's what it did. Where's my tea?"

He walked around the table, leaned his cue and picked up his cocktail. Harris's cheeks fully pucker as he sucks on the straw; the ice sagged downward in two dramatic steps. "So he basically had to lie his way out of paying for missing gear from a car he was still making payments on. Plus his dick was all fucked up from syphilis and he had these awful marks covering one side of his body. I think I was over here." Harris exchanged the glass for his stick and returned to the table, a little dancy in his step.

"I fucking love this one." he continued, "Anyway, the cops don't like him at interview but he catches work at Sands."
"Strip club 'Sands'?" I ask. Harris pockets the 5.
"Yeah, plus the GI bill payouts for some bullshit classes. He was making like, probably at least $5,000 a month. He's got the car, the job, school, all this money, there's strippers everywhere. He starts doing some coke. He's like 'I'm gonna do some drugs, that's what I'm gonna do. This is gonna be great.' I'd catch him here between, uh, shifts. School, work, shoot a game here, see the dealer, suddenly it's six and he's like 'Okay, I guess I better blow my nose and take a shower. Do it again.'"

"Yeesh." I said.

"Yeesh." Harris said. "The next bit is fuzzy. He said he can't remember what the combination was, but I saw him that night, and I'm fairly confident it was mushrooms and a psychopathic dose of dextromethorphan. He sounded weird. Like a caricature of a like, like a mentally disabled person. Really high voice, he couldn't really make his mouth do stuff. He must have fucking hit one of them reset buttons you need a fucking pen cap to hit, you know?"

"Nope."

Harris paused and extended his leg straight out behind him as cantilever while he bent at the waist fully over the table. He held the cue with his right hand way out on the table--from his bridged right fingers to his toes a ramrod straight line. The cue pistoned in parallel and the 4 crept off the table, bullying the 1 with it.

"It stuck on him. Like in his head. I didn't see him for a few days and when I did he was talking factions and the impending war." he said.

"Ugh, which one?" I made a show of rolling my eyes.

Harris squinted at me with a curious half-scowl then continued. "He quit everything. Smoking too. He looked good. Really good. Just like, a powerful animal. I don't know if he slept. I'm not sure if he needed to."

He shot again, retrieved his long island iced tea, and sat down next to me. The straw lolled around the rim of his glass waiting for his lips.

"I drove him to the VA. I mean he asked me to. He'd walked here from Beacon Hill. _Barefoot_. It's been a couple months, but I think he's steadied out. Lithium maybe? He drives one of those throne mowers all day. Anyway. Reborn."
