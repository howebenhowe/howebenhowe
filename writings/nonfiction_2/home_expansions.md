## I have to move to a new home soon
### Why I live here (arrived to NYC for the story thing, gotta make a home anyway)
	I moved to New York City to study at Columbia University. I enrolled to the university's School of General Studies, a college with administrative nuance designed to be more accomodating of non-traditional students. It is a small school within the university, but it touts the differentiating significance of each of its students' indirect paths to higher education. Most of my classmates had moved to New York from somewhere else like I did. Most of them had found apartments off campus like I did.


	I moved to New York City to finish getting a degree. I wanted to finish what I started. I many times identified my desire to make good on the faith my grandpa and family placed in me when supporting my efforts to get into school years ago. I am the center of some story being told; going back to school would fulfill that arc for me, and for how I think of myself in the eyes of my family. 

### Why I want to leave my current apartment
	I want to leave my current apartment because it doesn't feel like home. My apartment has kept me warm through the winter. It has afforded physical security to my person and my belongings. It has met with the basic requirement for shelter, but it isn't a home to me. The walls are a cold white, the cabinets have plasticky grey wood-grain veneer sides, whiteboard faces, and are edged with metal. The jolly neighbors across the landing moved out two months ago, victims of a better deal. All the other residents of my building live one of the four floors below. From my apartment door, I occasionally hear Zach getting home to 4F after a day teaching. For the most part, though, I shuttle up and down the black stairs from apartment to street without seeing anyone.
	My housemates haven't expressed my dissatisfactions with our apartment. **TODO** write about James being down for whatever but that meaning no preference with which to make improvements, Alex down for nothing at all and so prevents any change. Music/food/engagement in one another's lives (that last piece exists w/ me and james, so let's live together?)

### Is it even a home?
+ Open the question: what is a home?
## What do I want the next home to be like?
### Communal dream
+ recent life in 9 trianon
+ previous experience setting up Fiasco
+ significance to a community beyond its walls
### my own preferences
+ life at home as a kid
+ support for creativity
### Recreating some ideal (segue to definition)
## What has been my definition of home?
### society's old definition
+ white picket fence
+ money to buy something or build something
+ where you return to at the end of the day
+ where you 'end up' late in life
+ home is stationary relative to the globe (recent myth)
### society's new definition
+ optional
+ oddity to opt into that I flatter myself makes me hip
+ assumed to be impermanent
+ an arrangement of conveniences, locus of comforts
+ a good location
+ the start and end of most of your google maps queries
+ 70% of NYC residents rent
### basic definition
+ security
+ expression of self in physical space
What do I feel like I'm supposed to want from a home, per my particular social standing? A good location. The starting and ending location for most google maps queries. Temporary--what could be permanent? It belongs to someone else, of course. It is the center of conversations; we are forever asking people about their next apartment, congratulating or commiserating on the challenge of finding it. Notably absent: "I have my home. I have a new home." There's a limit to how much you feel you cn depend on a place if you don't own it fully. If a faceless organization can elect to kick you out or change the terms of your occupancy or refuse you a changing action in that space or enter your home without you wanting them to do that. Home feels like home in as much as it feels like the space that holds your physical self. It is the negative space you fill as a positive, and you shape it to reflect yourself. It is your negative body in the world. Being physically violated or intruded on in any way, having the conditions of your body changed without your consent or alignment with those changes, others attitudes dominating your own attitudes about aesthetics/whatever (thinly veiled body issues allusion)--all those things in the context of your physical body alienate you from your body, deprive you of embodiment. So too with your home.
### first home impressions
Wood floors. Meals with people. A place where taking my shoes off makes me feel more relaxed. A place I can't smell unless I'm cooking and I step out of the kitchen then back in. A place that looks like the time of day outside. A place my friends know. A place that my neighbors know. A place where I know my neighbors, and I know my neighbors' places. A place where, when someone enters, they see me in the place because they came to see me at that place. A place where, if someone I loved were to come stay, I would feel that I was sharing myself with them. A place where I feel pride in the positive impressions it makes on people, and a place where I feel wise to have ambitions that it make even more positive impression on people. A place where you don't recognize that you're leaving it because you leave it all the time, but you recognize when you come back to it. It has walls and windows. It has a kitchen that is central to the people who live there. It is a small safety amid uncertain greater world. It is free to be there, even if it costs money to have it. It is free to share with others. It is what you need, and it has the possibility of being what you want.
### inheriting parents' myths about home
+ head west
+ make a family
+ know your neighbors
### changing landscape of home
+ everything is liquid. Summon it when you want, dismiss it when you don't. Air bnb, lyft, music, files, taxes, money, voices, books, other cities, home
Permanence is on the way out. Don't expect things to stay. Progressivism is the politics of the future, and we're to race towards it. Don't carry cash, except as a charming affect--plastic is the way to go. Money as an ethereal idea. Hell, let's make it crypto and completely depart. Your photos should be in the cloud. Except you shouldn't even think about where they are -- they should either be directly in front of you, in front of your friend, or they shouldn't be at all. They should be summoned into existence at a whim, and dismissed from existence as quickly. 
+ contrast to Kay at the farmers' market
+ increasingly, cities
+ shifting priority away from location to being the hero of our stories, home is secondary (see Will)
+ growing sense of resource scarcity
+ growing sense that everything should be new
+ pervasive myth of heading west and building
+ idea that building from scratch is the activity of a baron, not the enterprise of any old person who wants to make a home
+ country becomes increasingly urban; more and more people living in city limits
+ fewer people have any participation in the fabrication of their home structure
+ contrast of my childhood home, which my dad has been tinkering at for thirty rs vs an apartment, which for the first decade of life in NYC is rarely the same mailing address two years in a row
+ things that are more permanent: restaurants, community gardens (cite Emily), bridges, graffitti (?)
+ the less you get to feel like you own and build your home, the more you need the world beyond your front door; the more you need to 
+ the idea of travel liberates a person from thinking of their home as a fixed place. Home becomes a feeling, and one that you can depend on. Now, who ever travels that doesn't expect the home to be waiting for them when they get back. 
### how new landscape kills/battles old myths
## How do you know when you are home?
### safety
## When a home stops being home
### Peter last man standing in apartment -> home serves life, when life neglected home stales
Peter in Berlin, having become a sad homebody to the detriment of his housemates' experiences. Having become the 'old hand' in the apartment, growing more jaded about the possibilities of newly arriving flatmates. Having completed innumerable projects and having developed the kitchen to a space within which he has grown and grown. Having been left behind by the life advancement of his peer group, invalidating what his being at home can mean.
### Kara infringements -> loss of social safety
Emily didn't feel safe at home any more. Safety -> absence of hostility. -> absence of needless judgmente / any judgement. Intention/respect for space, same wrt the effort/intention of creating home. Home is dependent on other people's...what? Participation?
Respect for identity/celebration of who each person is.

Marissa + Kara were amped on the basis of comfort, aesthetic, etc. After they moved in, Emily wasn't sure if when coming home there would be big changes towards one person's preferences (e.g. big couch in common space) -> emily felt they needed to make themself smaller just to survive in home. Consensus was gone, indpendent actors looking out for self had replaced. Identity stopped being the basis for the home, became something that had to be adapted to fit within the home. Disregard for what had come before and why it may have been arranged in the way it was; replacing things without consideration for what is being replaced undermines the predecessor's sense of home. Home space, within the home, is a limited resource -> if one person occupies more of the communal space, it throttles the others' resources. 
### Decomposition of 141 Bachelor Road -> significance of objects
My grandparents both die, and we walk through their old home identifying which of their belongings should go to which of their kids/grandkids. The home is dissolving, leaving behind a space, a cavity. We are helping it dissolve back out of definition, decomposing the art, furniture, utensils. Much of it sentimental, some of it functional, some of it valuable. Stickers and post-it notes appear on things. I have a jade plant and a ladel in my home. Two mugs, too. They are part of whatever I make home, that's why I bring them with me.

### Elon drifting away from 9 Trianon -> home as project/ dies without members
I move into 9 Trianon Plaza, the Shtetl. The house is big and falling apart, but the community within it enjoys ongoing augmentation and remodel. The getting of a dog. The development of ideals to share. How carefully we consider the new people we bring into the house. How we vet them. After vetting, how they are involved in full in the house, begin shaping in themselves. I arrived, it was impressed upon me emphatically that I would be a full member of the house from day one, that my will, contributions, an share in the whole would be equitable to the others' (hat tip Elias). That it is a home, that it has the identity of a home becomes reflected in how visitors indicate their experienece. Sometimes felt more like home, sometimes less. When less? When people drifted away during the summer time. Focus was lost, individuals would uphold their preferences, the feeling of a whole house dinner, or drifting through a space where your physical form was accountable to other people evidenced the diminishing sense of home. It was home because of the shared orientation towards growing it, and growing it is impossible when the other members have drifted off for summer months. Absence of quality time. 

## What prevents/precludes a home
### alex is inert or a drain -> different definitions of home can't coexist
Current experience of not-home. I get home and a part of my mental energy is allocated to moderating the degree to which I'm an imposition on my housemate Alex, or if I'm feeling vindictive, allocated to measuring how much vengeful annoyance I'm inflicting.
### home forever secondary to hero story
Will, without home. Chasing potential around and around the globe, reluctant to put down roots within any particular community as it might inhibit his pursuit of the Big Goal outwards, where he saves the world with his mighty ethic and effort. As a result, various stopping-over locations, living in places where he has elected not to buy permanent furniture because he didn't plan on being there for very long (this is another aspect of modern sentiment; we want what we will get to have forever over what will serve us in the moment -- don't buy/change/develop your current living arangement unless you're going to live there ...what, forever? What's the cutoff? We don't know.)
### bresee in a car -> character with no story (derides notion of god-power story writing)
Bresee, without home. Living in a car in defiance of paying rent -- didn't perceive an advantage to having a fixed address, prefferred to sleep in car in service of more liberties.
## When a home continues being home
### Jemil returns to New Orleans -> home as community, geography, smell, indellible
physical perspective: home is that place that you have a connection with and you know where you're from and you know what exists there
I know what this tastes like, I know what this is, I know 
It's about the soul, thesmell, the grit, your comfort level
home can be anywhere, but there's only one home, you're identifying perspective ,on connecting with something, even in a shack
it's a connection with that being, that soul, whatever terrible things or good things happen
this is my first experience looking at my family and seeing them all together
over the years you move about the country, but this is when I open my eyes and realize my surroundings
it's like taking a person who's lived on an island -- home could be in manhattan! -- doesn't matter how they acclimate, it's the first understanding of being

(what is the idea of origin linked with home?)

the further you move away from it, but as soon as you come back to it, the smell, the taste

come back to seattle, leave a hot ass place like new orleans, you notice that 'my body is accustomed to this, or to that' -- it's that first connection to being
first time you recognize you're human, you have shelter. Might sound crazy, but how could you have a connection with something and you've got all these homeless people. Where is their home? It could be gratifying to get this box together, a little mini home, whatever is comfortable for them. Even as a kid you can remember your grandparents' -- that was home.

you're never home unless you're home.

imagine going back to nola right after katrina -- the place i called home was gone, it was gone .I remember tat land that my grandparents had. And it was just gone. It was lik ebeing in some type of twighlight zone. Just going down there and that shit was just gone. But it was still home. 
### Visiting 7034 -> home has continued in same vein, but the space was needed

	My greatest familiarity is with the sensations of my body. My second greatest familiarity is with my childhood home. 7034 has been in a constant state of change since the winter of my birth. The week my twin brother and I came home from the hospital my father had begun remodeling our house by ripping the wall off of our kitchen. That January was uncommonly cold. For those first couple weeks while my dad was getting the kitchen wall remodeled, my grandpa stayed with my family and would keep our cast iron stove well fed throughout the night.
	It was equally cold when I visited this winter twenty nine years later. The front door handle is solid bronze, resolutely spring-loaded, and reports a stout 'clunk' as you press it to the bottom of its range. The door's face is bright red, but at the edges the underlying white primer peeks through chips in the paint. Even if some of the chipping is new, the door feels unchanged from my earliest memories of it. Pushing on the door, I can hear the thin sucking sound of winter air slipping around the peaking door jamb, leading the way inside. Bronze, whoosh, clunk, cold, all of it as indellible and familiar as a yawn in my throat or the sound of my own hum.
	My sister Eleanor and my five year old nephew Aspen have been living with my parents for the last two years. What was once my room is now Aspen's room. When he's more enthusiastic than he is orderly, his toys spill across the house.
	Now that my nephew and sister live there, my family comprises more bodies than we had beds. I slept on the couch, downstairs. Once, I woke up in the night needing to pee. I walked through the dark steadily, my hands found the doorknobs and my naked toes avoided the furniture. Such is my familiarity with my body, and my former home.

It is the same home I grew up in, but no longer my home. Aspen has taken my old room. I used to feel antagonism with the cluttered basement but it no longer bothers me. I am received by neighbors as a visitor. I can smell the house.
### Riley gives me a tour of the house in progress -> it had been in progress for years, home can move and grow from seed, part of an ongoing relationship through time
	My old friends Riley and Emma are remodeling their own home nearby. Emma was out when I stopped by, but Riley guided me through the improvements they had made in the year since I had visited. The copper plumbing had been inspected and approved, as had their electrical work. Riley and his dad had finished framing, insulated, and then hung drywall. Furniture, natural wood accents, and a newly installed heat pump had made the place several degrees more comfortable. In one short year their skeletal house had fleshed out.
	The house had belonged to his grandmother, though it had been vacant since she moved into assisted living long ago. Though he and Emma have only been back in Seattle for two years, they have been developing their plans for this house for much longer. I stayed with them in New Orleans when Riley was beginning his architecture program. Some nights they would watch an episode of the Great British Bake Off, other nights they would be reworking a fresh copy of their future floorplan. Their home had been a seed before it was a skeleton.
**TODO** the desire to make a home predated the inheritance, found expression in that structure
**TODO** sitting on the porch with Riley, saying hello to neighbors, bits and pieces of all their expressions of home

### Visiting 9 Trianon -> home moves on, the relationship is between different folks now
## Home is a relationship
### general set of relationships from society
I arrived blank, but by the time I was a genial, procrastinatory, creatively timid, affectionate, ad opinionated teenage son, I had accumulated notions of how I related to my community, my work, my art, my sexuality, my affection, and my home. Those ideas weren't hastily assembled, often from default scripts from society at large. To be happy in any of them, I had to take responsibility for the examination and development of those relationships.
##  When you don't take responsibility for your relationships you end up with bum ones. A city full of people who have broken relationships to home will
+ have to be able to identify the counterfeit
## what to keep from the above?
+ home is stationary relative to the person as they understand stationary

## the skeleton
- changing economic realities undercutting both of the bove
- changing environmental realities undercutting both of the above (cities, less construction)
- what makes home then
	- location
	- feeling
	- other people
	- security
	- expression
- depreciation of permanence, everything liquid

d now I'm at a moment of looking forward to a new home. I look forward to being done with my current non-home. I look forward to building something that I care about, and I'm curious what that something is. I'm fascinated by the idea of home, I'm interested in identifying its counterfeits because I have a vested interest in making for myself the real thing. The pattern plays out in relationships, that you just dive right in and then figure out what kind of relationship is right for you by trial-and-error, or something barely more elegant/sophisticated. Only in the last three years with Grace, in the efforts to create a relationship liberated from suffocating scripts about attraction, necessitated mutual sexual gratificiation, charting paths that are predictable and so unthreatening/security granting to our loved ones, have I really begun to take responsibility for what my most precious relationships are made out of. Therapy is that. Sex requires and then plays that same thing out. The most important pieces of a person's life, the relationships between themselves and themselves, between themselves and their loved ones, between them and their work, between them and their art, between them and their community, and between them and their home. Only the self is responsible for what those should grow to be, and it's sufficiently unlikely to merit the evaluation "impossible" that the society-generated default relationship that is handed to each of us is perfect.

### what I'm thinking of when I say home
Wood floors. Meals with people. A place where taking my shoes off makes me feel more relaxed. A place I can't smell unless I'm cooking and I step out of the kitchen then back in. A place that looks like the time of day outside. A place my friends know. A place that my neighbors know. A place where I know my neighbors, and I know my neighbors' places. A place where, when someone enters, they see me in the place because they came to see me at that place. A place where, if someone I loved were to come stay, I would feel that I was sharing myself with them. A place where I feel pride in the positive impressions it makes on people, and a place where I feel wise to have ambitions that it make even more positive impression on people. A place where you don't recognize that you're leaving it because you leave it all the time, but you recognize when you come back to it. It has walls and windows. It has a kitchen that is central to the people who live there. It is a small safety amid uncertain greater world. It is free to be there, even if it costs money to have it. It is free to share with others. It is what you need, and it has the possibility of being what you want.

### definition of home given me by society's
What do I feel like I'm supposed to want from a home, per my particular social standing? A good location. The starting and ending location for most google maps queries. Temporary--what could be permanent? It belongs to someone else, of course. It is the center of conversations; we are forever asking people about their next apartment, congratulating or commiserating on the challenge of finding it. Notably absent: "I have my home. I have a new home." There's a limit to how much you feel you cn depend on a place if you don't own it fully. If a faceless organization can elect to kick you out or change the terms of your occupancy or refuse you a changing action in that space or enter your home without you wanting them to do that. Home feels like home in as much as it feels like the space that holds your physical self. It is the negative space you fill as a positive, and you shape it to reflect yourself. It is your negative body in the world. Being physically violated or intruded on in any way, having the conditions of your body changed without your consent or alignment with those changes, others attitudes dominating your own attitudes about aesthetics/whatever (thinly veiled body issues allusion)--all those things in the context of your physical body alienate you from your body, deprive you of embodiment. So too with your home.

### permanence ebbs
Permanence is on the way out. Don't expect things to stay. Progressivism is the politics of the future, and we're to race towards it. Don't carry cash, except as a charming affect--plastic is the way to go. Money as an ethereal idea. Hell, let's make it crypto and completely depart. Your photos should be in the cloud. Except you shouldn't even think about where they are -- they should either be directly in front of you, in front of your friend, or they shouldn't be at all. They should be summoned into existence at a whim, and dismissed from existence as quickly. 

## vignettes of home

I visit Seattle and walk through my old neighborhood. I see Joe's old place, now owned my someone else. The basement windows are still deep in the shade of the towering pine tree, same as they always wee. Those were the windows I used to rap on to get Joe's attention, the windows I'd stare up out of from where we would be playing videogames or lounging on Joe's couch. Joe stopped using that place as a home gradually, as he graduated from college. Joe's folks sold the house and moved out. Now it's just a red house that I remember, where I could draw a to-scale floor layout of its various rooms.

My grandparents both die, and we walk through their old home identifying which of their belongings should go to which of their kids/grandkids. The home is dissolving, leaving behind a space, a cavity. We are helping it dissolve back out of definition, decomposing the art, furniture, utensils. Much of it sentimental, some of it functional, some of it valuable. Stickers and post-it notes appear on things. I have a jade plant and a ladel in my home. Two mugs, too. They are part of whatever I make home, that's why I bring them with me.

Grace shows me Omaha, the childhood home. It's sprawling in a humble way. Some plants and trees indoors so big it doesn't make sense that they would have been bought that size at any store. The same faces in photos at different ages. Everybody moves with the easy confidence of familiarity; things are always where they expect them to be. The dog patrols. The house swallows up the returning children. Rosie know how to summon everyone for a meal. The house is sold. I never go back to see it, though Grace will have it with her forever.

I move into 9 Trianon Plaza, the Shtetl. The house is big and falling apart, but the community within it enjoys ongoing augmentation and remodel. The getting of a dog.

Riley, making his home. Working on the idea for it with his future wife, his partner in home-making Emma. I stayed with them when I was first arriving back to New Orleans, and they put me up in a guest bedroom for as long as I needed. I remember watching the Great British Baking Show with them. Some bullshit TV, houseplants, music sometimes and a long string of warm rooms. Why was that shotgun a home when Slip's Pad was not? Why was

# outline
## I have to move to a new home soon
### Why I live here
I moved to New York City to finish getting a degree. I wanted to finish what I started. I many times identified my desire to make good on the faith my grandpa and family placed in me when supporting my efforts to get into school years ago. I am the center of some story being told; going back to school would fulfill that arc for me, and for how I think of myself in the eyes of my family. 
### Why I want to leave
The relationship with my housemates is inadequate to my definition of home. The physical home is cold and white, not open to adaptations from its residents.
### Is it even a home?
Open the question: what is a home?
## What do I want the next home to be like?
### Communal dream
I recently lived in the dream home, a collective of people who were committed to the home.
### Recreating some ideal (segue to definition)

+ money to buy something or build something
+ where you return to at the end of the day
+ where you 'end up' late in life
+ home is stationary relative to the globe (recent myth)
True homelessness: the oregon trail? An exodus? Trail of tears? Being evicted? Natural disaster that destroys your home structure? What makes a home has to be examined by what makes homelessnessss.
Home from the perspective of a young, wealthy man with every advantage in life: it's elusive. It's optional. It's an oddity to opt into that I flatter myself makes me hip. It's impermanent by default assumption. It's an arrangement of conveniences. It's where your parents live. It's the city where your friends live. It's the locus of comforts.
### first home impressions
+ hard wood floors
+ abundant light
### inheriting parents' myths about home
