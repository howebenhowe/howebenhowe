+ Add more stuff on Madeline
+ Add more mom
+ include more of my relationship with and instincts toward Madeline (incl. skinny dipping, post shift 3AM hang at her folks place
+ more personality to M and G, background (incl ghosting origin, douchey swole photos)
+ get more vicious
+ incl story of Valerie transcript
+ incl contacting Margot after the throwdown
+ incl more on M's parents being there
+ incl geo make-nice conversation
+ evidence my sensitivity/imposter feelings in that space
+ simplify conflict aversion sentence
+ incl more on who I am, what I want, what I'm feeling
+ per irie, what is the piece doing? I think it's saying; there is restraint, and there is full indulgence of disdain. Sometimes the high road, sometimes a fight, and sometimes unmitigated scorn
+ re. portnoy's complaint: indicate that I don't know what that books is about, but I know what my mother is about, and that she won't pass up a good opportunity to 

+ backstory before the rest, skinny dipping night after JBE, laughter from around the corner hearing her pee, the special quality of a lamplighted family home in the small 
+ the apology
+ 	talking on phone with dad, incredulity at a person's capacity for delusion
+  	thinly veiled threats of physical violence
+   endless spiel about Stanley Kubrick
+   holy motors viewing, belittling Madeline for not savoring the art. Belittling her in front of me. In her home. 
+   "do you want a fucking cookie?"
+ Valerie transcript
groans from title + first line, liked anticipation
enjoyed brevity of conclusion of action with Geo, liked it as one-and-done interaction w/G
story felt bigger than me + g, wanted more on M + ma, dynaices of those relationships, curiosity stirred re. my instincts towards madeline?
wanted more flesh to the rels.
wanted more sense of m + g's presonalities (incl. persona background, odds and ends of dialog?)
rlm likes the omissions, omitting g's full comment, omits my own anger process
likes how that leaves blanks, raises questions over who/why blanks should be filled, self-similarity between form and substance
ending sets up relationship between reader and writer, hints at the possibility that I(ben) might turn Geo at the end of the workshop
make the narrator more of an everyman thrust into petty situation
tone none too whingey, enough of a redemption arc that I tell geo off
mjs wants more gossipiness, experiment with abandon! Get bitchy! That, too, would serve the redemption agenda.
liked dialogue -> how to incl more when you are trying to only tell the truth?
mr neapo(sp?) wants speciment of Geo flavored feedback, examples of how he acts and behaves, it's zoom which amps up the awkward and gossip as zoom informs it
liked ma-me me-ma, electronic overlay throughout. Incl. other tex faff, zoom chatter type parallel dialog.
Mr. neape wants more on the other members of the room. Margo? M's folks? eyerolls and groans?
ML points out that there's ambiguity as to who induced the eyerolls -- was the narrator hte asshole? AITA?
this was an experiment in dramatizing as much as anything else
KR: favorite part is humor + flare, wants more of that. Lean into indulged pettiness. Go petty if true, (do I care iftrue? it's drama, tell it best?)
add more about group dynamic, wants description of geo
list out what info is offered on Geo: poet, M's boyfriend ...?
davy imagines the pink sweatshirt and mac demarco
RL likes that we get Madeline but not more than her name up front, finds it fitting to the Zoom environment (offer a short visual on a couple characters?)
include matter of Geo after, which would give more context to M and G characters
Nhi likes the ending-at-the-beginning approach
Give cause for interest up front, right fro the jump
without artist statement, not much evidence that the narrator is questionable. If I want the question of the narrator's cleanliness to be in question, gonna need more.
the nastier you write the narrator, the more likeable
there's evidence that narrator would be sensitive about right to be in a writer's space (stemming from first bit wrt. being new to the writing group), shows up in that narrator shows disdain for Geo
RLM: conflict allergic assertion is suss; followed immediately by conflict. Calls narrator into question; should give more illustration that 
ML: had to reread the conflict-aversion sentence a couple times for it to land, big bummer since it's a climax; confused for a sec if the conflict averse person is narrator or Geo -- clarify it but keep it spicy. It slowed him down when he wanted to most move steadily through.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

+ How to address a need for dialog without a perfect memory. So too with body language, etc? Am I not supposed to ask about that?
+ top knot + beard
+ thomas bernhardt (?) writer uses nasty characters full of venom -- who else to think of? Iago, etc?
