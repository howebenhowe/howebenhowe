## notes from my notebook, snatched from the jaws of illegibility

+ the last line survives: gave understanding
+ [folks were] on board with Milne
+ we like the goldfish + transition with it
+ liked lapse time
+ 2 for the goldfish quote-breaks
+ brevity [a f?] -> emphasizing time compression 
+ "up that porch" -> lynchpin line -> brings home time travel aspect

## negative disorientation:
+ Get the word 'nephew' in there, maybe the title? // I settled on not explicitly naming the nephew-uncle relationship; I'd rather let the reader decide if the boy is the same person as the narrator, because the similarity between nephew and uncle's similarity is much the point, so the feels important to maintain. Instead, I aim to relieve the reader of the impulse to sort out a family tree by making the same-grandpa and same-house pieces more obvious.
+ 'called' from first line
+ Beat missing somewhere to bridge to "didn't want" -> bottom 2nd 3rd paragraphs
+ distance introduced by "same one" feels physical
+ who is this man? // hopefully clarified by more explicit 
+ Caleb: not so important who/how related; use more detail to ground the reader
+ "Face and Body" orient the reader
+ don't want that day to end forward it to one moment -> how to appre[unintelligible] time // bummer having inconsistent handwriting
+ nix 'grandfather' ? make it 'my grandfather'? // no, but I'll reorder the sentence to downplay resolving that confusion from "the boy's grandfather would teach" to "the would later learn from his grandfather" -> the clauses of less importance
+ How to support that everyone besides boy has aged? // I dunno, and from where I stand weeks out from this thought, I don't think I care
+ why do I carve out the separation when I do? My classmates encourage me to draw out the development of relationship with Aspen before separating them in time // roger, wilco
+ "his" (grandfather mother) begs the father question // hoping other family-tree-minimizing changes have taken care of this
+ drop name, give familiarity // done
+ advance of relationship works for caleb -> progress from introduction to shared history its metaphor
+ include more of narrator's connection to grandfather + mother
+ apply flux-cont (?) more liberally to exaggerate the isolation of the boy // I wish I knew what I had meant to capture in this mysterious wisdom
