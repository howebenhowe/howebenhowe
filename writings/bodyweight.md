# Bodyweight
*after Frank O'Hara*

when we met it was all laughing  
or soon enough after Can you remember  
we paused only to gulp air  

those fields are all still there  
but fancier and crowded with leashes  
too much to slip through barefooted  

or careen around the lake  
funky and glad for slow summer time  
just drunk with time  

I feel the weight of my body now  
more than then but have  
we ever stopped laughing
