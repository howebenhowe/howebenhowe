# Report

New Orleans, but specifically, Frenchman Street, St. Roch, Hanks, EnVie

## EnVie
+ chess
+ pie
+ confession
+ money
+ place out of time, lights against sleep
+ the smell of every fourth patron
+ the vantage of the people who work there

## St. Roch Park/Hanks
### Peter's car
+ emptying out Peter's car
+ the neighbor's heckling him
+ the smell of the thing
+ the water in the headlights

### Hanks
+ with the exchange students
+ the flavor of the people who go there
+ the chef who's restaurant closed
+ Hannah without shoes but comes in anyway, vegetarian
+ buying food for five for $36 (12" poboy, 2 large fries, 9 pc thighs, fry sauce)
+ Hannah rolling cigarette for stranger, her schmooze, well wishing both ways
+ Sweet and funky swamp air, walking gaily at three in the morning, just like everyone else we saw
+ rotating whose hands held what
+ denying the plastic bag for the food
+ open carry on the chef, "c'mon" in his tone of voice, piling into a brolic truck already 

## Frenchman
+ sitting curbside with Hannah
+ "rescue me from this man"
+ pregnant with a wine bottle secure between the packing peanuts
+ foul Bugler tobacco
+ the art market, the older man with his hand marking territory (possession) at the nape of a much younger woman's neck
+ the bus, preceded by a popping-heavy dance act who staked out every ten feet of advance, line of ubers and tourists behind the bus, the blistering volume f the party bus, cameras held to the windows, stately crawl like Prince Ali's arrival, swirling purple and green lighting inside, the dancer eventually climbing into that bus, the twerking in front of the bus and the dancer's reaction
+ old man with a sword at one hip, cane in the other, notices me observing him, pulls the sword out (for what?) with hooked teeth like a fantasy weapon, looking for something in his cup?
+ man dancing with a water bottle on his head
+ more cigarettes, more cigarettes
+ the tables like a village green
+ the cowboy behind the bus, the horse unaffected
+ the drunk hot college men and women, carbon copies of one another, all tried out for the part of extras and all got the part, drank like character actors even though everyone was going to make the team (fix this)
+ pallet in the gutter, wobbly even as a patch, Hannah like everyone in heels (pair with packing peanuts)
+ taking selfies with a stranger's phone, no wait, it's a friend's phone
+ posts descending from the balconies above, what amusement park doesn't have corrals?
+ the park at the end of the street
+ the y-bend street splits into neighborhood at the other end
+ homeless people in the park at one end, well ordered homes at the other, the perilous hedonism that cuts through the middle
+ bicycle michaels (NOT bike mike's), somehow operating
+ the arrival of a few chains (SHAME!) like dat dog, the perseverance of old establishments
+ music tuned to attract, but not overawe, hanging with Sam (beer spilled on music deck, the ipad wander, the falling out for Cafe Negril's lack of regard for Sam's skills, Sam's pride)
+ the New Jersey fellow ("Sashe"?) with the fried chicken, a cup with drumstick bone and cigarette butts in it, as if trash was being contained, which it is, but only as much as at a party, which it is
