respond/retell a myth from own community OR a natural entity to write about "center a natural being" -> swamp dog hobble
thistle, for grandma

themes and questions
+ natural and unnatural
+ house as structure that should facilitate life, NYC construction is pretty hostile to that (lack of natural light, plants suffering, bars on windows)
  + yet life comes though off a good rain to a degree that's bad for the lungs (mold)
+ the mythology of items you bring to a house, how they are what make the place feel 'lived in' to an onlooker
+ walk through a room when nobody is home? Maybe tonight, take a pass through the house and take some notes. Late. Whoops.
+ what life the objects hold, especially to those people who have lived with them for awhile
+ "lives happen to objects", especially the ones brought to the house
+ a voluntary community evidenced through the totems of their identities that they pool together in one or another room, literally sharing the fragments of our lives for common use and benefit
+ STRETCH THE STRUCTURE objects are to the housemates as soil is to the potted plant; start with enough tokens for the people to take root.
+ mug as touchstone stoneware
+ burned spatula
+ housemates as organisms
  + behavioral patterns
	+ needs
	+ interactions
	+ preferred environments
	+ native vs transplant
+ the house
	+ landlord special everywhere you look
  + hummus colored wall
	+ previously for a family then chopped to multiple, urban density, felling a tree for a next suite of young delicate getting-started trees to sprout up. Honestly, the metaphor holds economics be damned.
	+ the building itself dying of neglect; no longer benefiting 
	+ building to the north, Darth Vader Arms, black with parallel balconies waiting for a North Korean missile march down too-narrow street
	+ overrun of lantern flies, killing the trees
	+ surveillance cameras, scanning for activity so as to deter it
	+ runners of surveillance wires throughout the house, veins but grosser
	+ doors, subdivisions, arrival of locks inside the house, the formal assertion of space divided by will, the twist of the wrist, the metal clack of finality, a guillotine on what?
	+ one of the previous families still has an order of adult diapers delivered monthly--is the former recipient still alive?
	+ those diapers have been passed along through Facebook Buy Nothing, repurposed through the group which is itself a repurposing of an apparatus of consumerism, advertisement, surveillance, kind surveillant
+ Coordinate the group through WhatsApp, the app offers an AI interaction to our group, 
pay attention to the narratives we have around us already. The house as a naked space, barren. Landlord special everywhere. At some point previous, built to house a family, then chopped to multiple. The building dying from neglect. Bars welded and bolted over the windows. The building to the north, the Darth Vader arms, painted black with so many parallel balconies. The back yard with a plastic frill grass fence leaning into it, pushed over by the cars that are parking in the back of that building. The overrun of the lantern flies. The surveillance cameras, scanning for activity in a way to deter it. The runners o wires through the house like so many veins, but something grosser. The doors, the subdivision, the arrival of locks inside when it was chopped into multiple units for different families. One of them still has adult diapers delivered. But those diapers have been passed along through Facebook's buy nothing program. Itself a strange re-purposing. No way that I can tell for Facebook, king surveillant to make a buck off my giving some adult diapers to a stranger. AI offering on my WhatsApp group, suggesting I have chat's  with simulacrum person, when what I use WhatsApp for is largely coordinating withe people with whom I live. What need could I possibly have for more retreat? Also that though this entire enterprise is many, many steps from anything natural--though what is 'natural', from anything that is enshrined or supported or celebrated as natural, it's still as good a place as any to get  started. Swamp dog hobble the native plant species, but of course not a native name. From the botanic garden, a highly artificial space. But artificial meaning showing the hand of the human contributor, a result of efforts. Starting from the absence of the good thing, no point in lamenting the lack of the original state and throwing hands up in dismay. Instead, get started where.

## Botany
I was walking in the garden in the between season, a botanical intermission, when blooms and fruits had retreated from view. Like most anyone in the Brooklyn Botanic Garden in the fall, I was there for the weather, for the movement in my legs, and for the reminder in miniature of the messier world in which our tessellated city is staked. The pond and it's idiotic fish do their job just as well in snow and sun, but the rose garden was shuttered, the cherry trees naked of any blossom for another six months, and the prickly pears most dramatically collapsed from a cold night that broke their stiff engorgement.

I headed to the native plants section, hoping that the longer lived residents of the area there might have some hardier green to show this winter than their delicate transplant counterparts. It was pretty dead there too. Visually, anyway, though my criteria biases toward exploding color, vegetation begging to be noticed, but as it got cold even the native plants employ more sensible strategies and hold their flamboyant displays until the spring when they might serve some function. 

The name didn't look like it belonged to anything when I found it. "Swamp Doghobble" on black plastic card, black card on a rod, rod stabbed in the ground. So I plucked the name, kept it in mind for later.

## TODO continuity between garden and the house, probably not the below.
# "How about 'Crash House'" Jamie offered--somehow he's found a name for our intentional community less creative than a license plate number. "'Swamp Dog Hobble'?" It catches. The house that catches us, all seven, is a 

Security cameras -- what they had seen through time.
Window bars -- what they were installed for, times changing.
Hummus paint -- layers of color beneath.
Lantern fly destroyed tree -- kid who stabs a pit in the dirt one time.
Basement mold -- the same colony that had been surviving in that basement for decades.
Porch sag -- nothing to do there!
Diaper delivery -- death, obviously.
Former owner drifting to the back yard -- bizarrely territorial, her previous ownership, yet asking if basement is available for rent.
Objects in the home, my objects, though equally casting objects to the people -- spatula, mugs.

A name from a plant, a sequence of objects arrayed, all of it with slintering backstories, none of it with the names of any people.

The house, it's contents, it's name, all things that nobody else seemed to be using.

It's all from somewhere else. Every bit of the house from somewhere else, salvaged or repurposed. The house itself, even our name. "Swamp Dog Hobble", plucked off a black plastic card, the card stuck to a rod, the rod stuck in the ground of the Native Plants section. The name didn't look like it belonged to anything when I found it.
