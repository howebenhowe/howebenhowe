## profile - Bresee

prominence of his musculature, especially when shirtlessly coordinating a track stand on bicycle in lamplight New Orleans streets after pedicab shift, body bled of excess, impoverished from crack.
Bicycle hung from a stop sign.
Comes back to bike, would-have-been thief encountered and stopped just before. Peter smiles, gotcha.
Flailing at geese with deflated bike tire.
Downhill behind Riley's car, cresting 60, no helmet, vehicle full of concern but none in that wind.
Sitting on top of the Starbucks, Nozomi, betrayal of my story to Jemil.
Coacoa spill down chin.
Guitar hero? Basement pocket room, window I can tap on to summon him.
Receding hairline from the first, "lightbulb head", growing it long to be jesus for halloween, still long like mustachioed jesus, but really like a composer in full color, only the mustache.
Snoring so loudly.
Effeminate cigarette smoking, each drag like blowing a kiss.
Curb sitting.
Racing people from a bar.
