# Coffee Tasting Notes

There is a person standing in line in the cafe. They have just arrived to the front of that line, and for the first time since I spied them looming, they smile. Fifteen minutes have passed since they decided to wait for, what, a cookie? It happened too fast, here at the consummation of the diorama, to take not. Notes of some things, I guess. Rewinding, though, I've never seen such performance of impatience from someone older than 5 before. They must have been 45. Eyerolls, puffing cheeks, tapping their cgredit card on the harshly lit glass pastry dislpay, shifting weight from leg to leg, their skirt folds swaying like insufficient soothing countermeasure. Nothing doing, the people all around them having a good old time yucking it up.

"Feeling... [gestures twice with forearms lifting and palms cupping] ...Fela's spirit. And such amazing music." His compatriot mimes a dance movement, bending his knees and then wiggling as he rises. His reflection wobbles crazily in the flat stainless steel back panel of the cafe's La Marzocco espresso group.

Only when I'm brushing my teeth, the instapot's long red hexagonal bars jitter. When I arrest my wrist, the lights steady.

"It's espresso all lower case." "All lower case?" "Lower case."
