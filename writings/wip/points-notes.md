# On Points (notes)

## dating apps
+ the look/feel is a game
+ limit to how many swipes you can put up, but you can buy more (same as lives in candy crush)

## grades
+ the integrity of an interaction goes up once grades aren't part of it, for example, Caleb's running relationship with Sam is all office hours, pro bono

## messages (notifications) and emails
+ (unread) counter bubbles
+ people silencing their phones
+ "omg, my bff rose" => pitching high-speed texting as desireable for old and young => the more you chit-chat with messages the more engaged you are

## Facebook friend count => influencer audience count => reactions, traction

## habit tracking
+ the unbroken chain
+ showing it to my brother
+ AA tokens
+ 

## aware of our inclination toward games, we manipulate ourselves for better and worse
