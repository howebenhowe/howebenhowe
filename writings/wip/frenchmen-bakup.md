# Frenchmen

The bus waits to be full. People trickle out of the manor, their wedding costumes loose from dance and alcohol. My friends, the handful that I knew at the wedding, pile into the bus ahead of me. Hannah has my arm--I weight it so she'll turn. The other five are already inside, faces framed and lit against the dark street like exotic fish.
"I'm going to walk. I'll see you there." She doesn't ask if I'm sure, just salutes the adventure and turns.
"Where's Benji?" asks RJ as I unmoor, drift down the street. Before I make the corner the sounds of the reception are swallowed by live oaks, and stiff leaved zoysia grass. Just my boots clip-clop over heaving panels of sidewalk, root-shoved and mud-sucked.

The couple had stood central on a blazing porch. White-painted folding chairs in ripples outward with us in them. Andrew's smile kept slipping toward agony he was so happy. Standing in profile holding hands like that they had made a doorway. Looking through it, we who knew them saw their future, our past. I wasn't much thirsty after that, dancing seemed impossible, so I smoked, rolling cigarettes with idle fascination until they started loading the buses for Frenchmen street.

The reception smoked all my tobacco, so I pick up a pouch of Bugler from Discount Zone. Christ gas is cheap in the South. The tobacco is terrible, so stiff and punky I doubt it'll catch in swamp air, but it does. My eyes are starting to hurt, I can't tell what from. Maybe keeping them open so late yesterday, or the smoking. Maybe spores drifting down from the tiny resurrection ferns that curl off street-spanning oak boughs.

There's a brick patio crescent in front of St. Anna's, with a bench in it, and a street person in the bench, sleeping. A low wall opposite his closed eyes catches unsteady light from a gas lamp. It's etched with rows of names. The font is very small; I'm sure they're all dead.

I turn onto the quiet end of Frenchmen, and the peals build as I near--car horns and trombones, cackles, sound in insurrection. Washington Square to my left is snuffed and chained for the night. A man is sitting on a pad of cardboard with his back to the wrought iron fence. He's far enough to sleep but close enough to need the five dollar bill from my arriving wallet. I cross the last street, and am abruptly amid them all. I gimbal my torso and send my feet to the empty paths between people. I slip past drunk-blank Tulane students. I dodge tourists in their trains of three and more, all smiling pride for their pilgrimage to the famous street, hoping to be convinced they are having a good time. The Spotted Cat has its door open, and as I traverse the spill of sound it takes shape out of the din. A few snare hits draw my eyes through the frame: three in profile watching the drummer, seeing the rhythm that drew my eyes to their faces. With the next step I'm out of the pocket of sound and back in the din.

I find Maison, our after party venue, at the far end of Frenchmen. There are a few picnic tables across the sidewalk from the bouncer, decorated with the discard of ebb vice: plastic cocktail cups, beer bottles, cigarette butts, Hannah, and an older man clinging to her attention. Maison is thundering, so Hannah asks loudly with her eyes and face for my help sloughing him. She rolls for me, but is struggling a full bottle of wine she's nestled between her breasts to smuggle inside. I could take the bottle? No, "It's safe in my packing peanuts!" she delights.

We step across a wobbly pallet laid at the edge of the curb over a puddle of street juice and make for the night art market.

At the art market gate, we lean for cigarettes before pushing into packed booths. The cars ooze by at night, the street a clumsy parade. A school bus inches up the street blasting Big Freediah bounce music. A young man scampers off out and steps in front of the bus. He starts dancing. His movements are tight and exuberant, visibly exertive, but his face is all performance. He keeps his hips rotated out, his knees bent. Whatever his chest does, his groin is available. Arms cock and extend, head twitches. Women with big butts wake up from the crowded sidewalk, whoop, emerge to shake their asses generally and literally. A few plant their hands on the filthy street and raise their backside before bouncing. The dancer pantomime's shock, crosses himself. He takes a few steps farther in front of the bus and returns to his act. The bus creeps forward. People inside it are shadows. Only the top windows are cracked, leaking faces and raised glasses. Spots of red, blue, and green light whirl on the curved ceiling.

The dancer fatigues. I think he's cheered when he climbs back aboard the bus, but it's hard to pick apart the shrieks and whooping. The bus draws past us. Trailing it, a cowboy. His horse is calm. When he tugs softly at the reins, the horse slows and waits, the bus waits, the next dancer dances. Behind them all, a parade cars. I wonder if the people in them ever get out, or if it's only safari, to view the wildlife at safe remove.

# Sake guy (the party that just got started)
I come back outside, and Hannah's made a friend. Sake? Can't remember. From New Jersey. Young and hale, eyes not wide but nearly. Shirt and hat looked fresh like he'd purchased them that morning. Probably had, it's a shopping trip? Box of fried chicken, waiting for friends, like us, making friends, like us. Conversational, but where Hannah is locked in, he's drifting with his attention, animal out of habitat.

# Sword + drink-on-head guys (the party that ran too long)
The old man with the sword, sees me noticing him, stops walking to shuffle the objects between hands and pockets so that he can draw his sword to--what, draw some change? Indicate his regency? He shuffles on sometime after I've looked away. Other man has nothing about his person--tattered khaki cargo shorts, a tank top, a face smeared from alcohol, but he makes a show of his full cup, places it on top of his cap-hanging head and sets to dancing about like a bug underneath it. I never see if he get's paid. I don't know if that's what he wanted.

# poets
The array of poets recreating an assembly line for regurgitated lines on typewriters. All of them cosplaying as the street urchins that they actually are, costumed to fit the street that they give identity to and have done for a hundred years. I'm stone sober, smoke another cigarette.

# Jordan fear (include? No?)
Jordan expresses fear, leans her head on my shoulder, her hand at my back. Fear and comfort. I encourage her to move to New Orleans. She claims she couldn't handle it--not the drugs and raucousness, but just the departure from familiar. I counter that she can, anyone can, many many do. We walk back to the AirBnB where we are staying. Hannah loses her filters on the way, threatens to turn around. Leaves her shoes on top of a bollard, prefers the barefoot stroll. Makes friends with a dog, Hank, in the last blocks. The next day I walk past the bollard. One of the shoes is still on top of it, the other one is bulldozed in the rode, soggy from rain.

## First trip 2013:

blurry, maison, spotted cat, etc. Overwhelming, tagging along with my bigger sibling cohort.

## Move to New Orleans:

Going on my own terms, riding bike through Frenchmen. Graeme's visit, get's wasted, I pick him up and put him on my couch. He leaves the next day.

Will visits, John. We see a soul act. The beer tastes good, her voice matches the hot brass around it. Searing, commanding, at the edge of control, but just this side.

## Move back to New Orleans:

The fella on the streetcar heading back from Frenchman, mov

Arrive to Nola/Frenchmen on Halloween. Do we drop acid? I believe so. Careened into town from New York, the road, smokey mountains, Brian's euphoric acid trip, the waiter in who-knows-where with the desserts they didn't have and the credit card that she forgot was something you hand back to the owner. Brian and Will stay for only a day or two. Maybe none. I stay at Riley's.

An overwhelming plate of chicken fried rice split with Peter, the best fuel-per-dollar a pedicabber can find without leaving the quarter, pedicabber gas station.

Bicycle Michaels, a visit during the day. Dropping off my bike that needs work, the failure points. Wheels dangling from the ceiling, the reversal of the city's inclination for alive at night, this guy's character is fully on display during the daylight hours, and the shop disappears at night. Rivnuts as attachment points following the failure of my braze-ons. Not bike mike, some bullshit uptown near Tulane's campus. Too many 5-star reviews. You want the one older than stone, with peeling hand-painted signage.

## Visit with work:

Toward the end of the team's retreat to New Orleans, we walk to Frenchmen from Hotel Peter & Paul. Team meeting during the daytime in the church next door. Cavernous. Three round tables separated, a couple folks grouped on just chairs. When we eat, I pull all the chairs to one table. Thick wood underfoot. Dawit improvises on the piano, I ask if he's playing Emahoy tunes because the twirl and tumble of delicate sound reminds me of her. No, just improvisation in that tradition. Two or three groups stroll to Frenchmen. We find our way to [the one with longitude/latitude in its name] and trombone shorty and hot8 (I think?) take the stage. I see my coworkers dance for the first time, all of them smiling into blue, pink, purple light. We walk home in a couple different groups. While on her way back, Sarah is harassed. Someone asks her for directions, and when she approaches the car to speak with him, can see he's masturbating. She arrives back to the hotel rattled.

## Wedding visit:

The reception was winding down. It had been warm all day already, and many of the attendant older generation had gamely participated in the second line. We made a block as a second line, napkins teased through the air, sweat accumulating on brows. Then dancing, food. I kept a little ways out though, mostly smoking. Smoking and wandering. That's what a wedding is for, wandering. Eyes, mind, the rest. Speculate on whatever else. The wedding ain't about them, is it? I burned through the rest of my tobacco in short order that night. Cigarettes were the only excuse I could proffer for drifting away from the dance floor. Didn't feel like dancing, not quite. Why? Seeing Scott and Elayna make endless twirls, or seeing Andrew's mom lean her positively geriatric head against his shoulder for a song that included the heartbreakingly on-the-nose lyrics "you are the wind below my wings"--all of it drove me away from the boogie. I wanted my people. I wanted a perch away where I could talk. I drifted until I found one. On the porch I encountered Jeanette, who remains devastatingly beautiful. Only, she's simple. So are many of them, in that space. Happy, resolved to their stories. I'm irresolute. I keep company with Hannah in the Gossip Chair, twisting our bodies into conspiracy, forever tipped to walk apart from one another. We burn through our respective bags of tobacco steadily. I've never stank so much, but my suit finer than just about any around me, on account of the fancy-pants company I worked for. But none of this is what matters to the dispatch, none of this is what happened. What happened was
