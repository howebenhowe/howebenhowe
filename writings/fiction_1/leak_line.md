# meeting the characters
They both had too much to drink, but especially Bridgette. She lay slung along the wooden bench, nevermind the dividers intended to discourage stretching out. Peter was sitting up, mostly, and would soon emerge from his stupor.
It was hard to remember quite what he was thinking about from moment to minute. His consciousness was tightly focused in time, pared down to the instant in front of his eyes. His eyes were still closed, though, and his consciousness was making clumsy circles on Dana's smile. It had been brief, but still doubled-up--more glance than can fit in an accident, and Peter had kept gazing after she looked away. He'd kept his eyes on her as he threw back another few fiery shots. Now he was sitting, head hung and eyes closed, looping through the evening repeatedly, lost to the present.
Bridgette, by contrast, is loose in a smear of color and sensation. She twitches a little, but dopily, like the twitch of an animal long since caught in a trap. Her feet abutted the end of the bench, her knees bent above the first armrest and her neck and head curled up against the second. She had stuffed her raincoat into the corner of the armrest, given herself just enough bed-shape to spill onto. Her hair was a tousled mess making a rats-nest snarl with her raincoat beneath. She had tucked her bare hands between her thighs but slid them against each other from time, the denim doing precious little to address the cold.
Something outside of his reverie disturbed him, and Peter blinked a few extra times. He lifted his head. The traces of his stupor were wearing away. Squinting his eyes closed and lifting eyebrows, he brought his mind forward into the present. Ah, that's it; somewhere up the platform a steady plink-plink-plink of the evening's rainwater was hitting the track floor. Concrete tiles poured to look like flagstones, but really just a hard quilt of gum smears, tar droplets, or other inscrutable adhesive. The light is dimmed where they are--one of the fluorescent tubes has given up--which is why they alighted on that particular bench. Funny, it's quieter than when they arrived. Weren't there voices before? But no train came in either direction. At least, not one that either Peter or Bridgette had noticed.
"Hey Bridge. Bridge... yeesh" he muttered while rising to his feet. Peter shook his head lightly and blinked a couple times. He reached towards Bridgette and put his hand on her shoulder. Her coat crinkled under his fingers and his weight shifted toward her as the fabric collapsed.
"Bridge, c'mon." he said, jostling her clumsily "I think we might have missed our train."
But Bridgette only mumbled and shifted the posture of her head on her wooden pillow. Peter straightened up, pushing off Bridgette in a final petulant bid for her company, and steadied himself looking about.
The sign above him read 'Uptown & The Bronx'. There wasn't much to find to Peter's left: a little disappointment from the steady red glow of the subway controller light; brick-red I-beams holding the street above with pools of grease-scummed bleach solution at their feet; the tunnel running away from him, disappearing into black. He blinked a few times, pulling the focus of his eyes back from the ambiguous depth of the tunnel and turned, back up the platform, where they had come from and shuffled off.
"Ouch! Shit" Bridgette yelped. She was halfway up, but facing away from him.
"You alright?" Peter asked.
Bridgette replied, fussing the while with her raincoat: "Yeah, just... my hair is caught in my... goddamnit."
With a decisive tug, she pulled the last tangle of hair from the raincoat zipper.
"How much longer? Does it say?" She asked, looking over at Peter. His pale face was cast marble in the glow of the train display.
"No, it says 'maintenance'. I tried to check my phone, but-." Peter pulled out his phone, tapped at it a couple times, then continued “..yeah, nothing down here.”
"What? Lemme see." Bridgette swung her boots to the floor and pulled out her phone. "No, yeah, you're right. I see the same thing. I didn't see any notices or anything on our way in, though." Bridgette glanced around at the pillars, walls. All the usual grime, but no scheduled maintenance fliers.
Peter crossed over to the other side of the track and looked up and down.
"Ha! We have it to ourselves, Bridge. Nobody else here."
"You see a notice--paper--announcement thing over there?" she asked.
"No."
Bridgette stood up, rolled her neck, and put on her raincoat. "Well, I hope it isn't raining any more. I'm cold." she said, heading up the platform toward Peter. He nodded and hunched his own shoulders higher, turning to walk with her toward the stairs.

# the entrance is locked
The turnstyles were encrusted in black paint, the revolving door kind where they lock up when you try to enter but spin freely when you leave. Only--
"What the hell." said Peter. He had pulled his sweatshirt sleeves down over his fingers before grabbing a hold of the turnstile door bars.
"Peter, c'mon." said Bridgette, stepping in to displace him.
"No, I'm serious, it won't go." Peter said. He walked off toward the emergency, bicycle, and stroller door. Bridgette gave the turnstile a good shove and an inspection before following him.
"This one too?" She asked. Peter was repeatedly jamming the stainless steel bar. With every shove, the bar only moved a fraction of an inch before it hit something. Peter's percussion echoed off the subway entrance wall opposite them and down into the platform.
"No, it's jammed. I, uh, I'm not really sure what to do, Bridge." Peter gave one more shove, then shook his hands, fingers red from the cold, before stuffing them into his pockets.
They stepped back and looked back and forth at the gridded steel membrane that obstructed them. The booth opposite was brightly lit, but totally still. Stacks of paper, some notices taped to the glass and a clock showing 3:32.
"Wait, there!" said Bridgette, pointing through the grate at a flier midway down the tiled wall. They both moved closer, peering.
"'Planned service change'" read Peter, and paused.
"What change?" Bridegette asked.
"I can't make it out. It looks--smeared? 'No *something something* at this station all weekend'." said Peter.
"This blows and I'm cold." offered Bridgette.
"Yeah."
---
# back on the platform
They walked the platform twice, certain they had missed something in the tiled walls, but there was only the one staircase, the one entrance. Back at the stairway, Bridgette stopped walking.
"So?" she asked.
"So it's gonna be a long, cold night Bridge." replied Peter.
"Cold night? You mean cold weekend? We can't stay here, Peter." said Bridgette.Peter shrugged and hand-flopped.
Bridgette turned to face him fully, “Peter, we can’t stay here. It’s cold and no trains are coming. We don’t know if anyone is coming.”
“Yeah, well, we have nowhere to go.” said Peter, turning from Bridgette back toward their bench, but Bridgette grabbed his shoulder. Peter turned back, glum. Bridgette countered with a smirk.
“The tracks, Peter. We’re going to walk to the next station.”
“What? Bridge, no.”
“I think we have to. Besides, if it’s closed all weekend, no other trains are going to run through here.” excitement was beginning to creep into Bridgette’s voice. She waited for a moment, eyebrows high and expectant. Peter shuffled his weight and glanced back at the staircase.
“Outstanding” said Brdgette, turning towards the tracks and walking off.

# Peter climbs down
Seated on the studded yellow edge of the platform with his legs swinging, Peter suddenly appreciated how much open air hung between him and the tunnel floor.
"You sure? We can wait." Bridgette said, her hand squeezing lightly at his shoulder.
"No, yeah, I'm good. I just, ah..." The sentence dissolved as Peter surveyed the floor below. His eyes were adjusting a little to the dark from this close. He twisted around, his hips now hanging free and his weight on his palms. After adjusting his grip, he lowered himself down slowly. The toes of his shoes scraped the tunnel wall as he descended, his jeans dragging with a sick his.
"How far?" he asked, voice tight. Bridgette was kneeling on the studs in front of him, hand still on his shoulder.
"How far what?" replied.
"To the ground, Bridge. How far?" Peter said, his fingers flexing.
"Oh, uh, one sec." Bridgette scrambled sideways, but her knees protested their misuse and her legs kicked out ineffectively, "You're-ah-looks like just a couple feet."
Peter lowered himself down slowly, dragging his belly across the sharp yellow lip and probing the wall and air with his toes searching for the bottom. Peter shifted as his elbows flattened to the platform when suddenly his grip buckled. His feet skidded on the wall and he stumbled as he touched down, toppling over the nearest rail in a sprawl.
"Peter! Shit, you okay?" Bridgette called. She flipped, recreating Peter's motions, and hurriedly dropped to the track floor. Peter was already getting up.
"Yeah. And ow." he replied, wiping his hands on the sides of his pants.
"Your pants," said Bridgette, "are a little dirty."
Opaque, greasy black smears ran down Peter's thighs.
"You don't say." replied Peter, looking up. His hair was matted on the right side and his cheek was newly moist and gritty. He wiped at it and scrubbed at his hair with the sleeve of his sweatshirt.
"Let's just get going." he said, turning and heading up the tracks. Bridgette hesitated a moment before stepping in line behind him.

# leaving the initial station

Even though he's only a few paces in front of her, Peter was quickly swaddled in the close dark. Bridgette groaned pointedly, dramatically, and trotted after him. She put a cheerful canter into her stride, hoping to pry Peter from his glum mood with by the chipper clip-clop of her footfalls. Her pace echoed down the tunnel. Bridgette could make out an occaisonal hiss and dribble, but otherwise their walking was the only activity. In spite of her will to adventure, the emptiness of her gesture settled on Bridgette, clammy and cold.
"Goddamn it's cold!" she said, loudly. Her voice hung lonely in he air for a moment before wearing out.

"I'm not worried about catching a chill, Bridgette." Peter spoke softly into the silence. He paused his walk for a moment and fished out his phone. His fingers were waxy with chill and it took him a couple stabs to get the flashlight on. He was shaking a little, only partly in shiver. Without turning back to Bridgette, he resumed walking. His arms were crossed tightly across his belly and as they walked, he made sure to keep up a little distance from Bridgette. It was enough that she was behind him; he needed the quiet to get a handle on things. His ankle stung from his clumsy drop. His sweatshirt clung wetly plastered to his right side, but those discomforts were fleeting. Mostly, Peter was peering. He squinted uselessly up and down the tunnel and tried to catch any sound, any sign of motion along the tracks.

"Alright, alright, I cave. would you please slow down?" Bridgette said. Peter had been unsteadily speeding up for a few minutes when she reopened dialog. After the third time she saw him catch his injured foot on track tie, she had to call for a slowing.
"Wait, shhh" Peter said".
"Huh?--" Bridgette broke off. A creaking sound and a rumble was coming down the tunnel toward them. Bridgette closed the gap to Peter placing her hand on his shoulder.
"Train?" she asked, but what she heard was heavier than the trains they had ridden that afternoon.
"I'm not sure," Peter said, "but let's get off the tracks in case it is." 
Bridgette clambered to tunnel edge and then up to the narrow access walkway a few feet up the tunnel wall. Peter followed, and they perched together.

# maintenance train

"Gotta be a train," Peter said, "but it's a slow one."
The groaning grew louder, the texture of clanking and churning began to fill the closed space with tumult. The nose of the maintenance train finally entered Peter's small sphere of phone light. It lumbered along the parallel tracks, a mechanical beast of burden. The posts and beams between the two parallel lines obstructed Peter's view of the train, interfering with his survey.
He shouted over the din to Bridgette, "Nobody on that first car."
"What?" Bridgette said, but Peter couldn't here her at all, and he was trained on the trundling cars. Garbage bags were piled high through the barge-like middle cars, silhouetted mechanical apparatuses, and what lookel like a heap of clothing, but no people, and no movement. Bridgette shouted something to him, but all that registered with him was the rhythm of her sound, itself swallowed by the confusion in the tunnel. She might have yelled again, but Peter's attention was perpendicular, her clamor was outside his awareness and obstructed by static. The train took minutes to roll bye.

When the last car was pulling away down the tunnel from them, Bridgette said again: "Did you see anyone?" Peter, silent, blinked a few times and turned toward her.
"Huh?" he asked, dazed. She asked him again, "Any people?"
"No." he replied, stiffly. Peter shook his head vigorously for a moment, clearing the sound from his head. They got down from the walkway and continued in the direction the train had come from.

# tree roots

Bridgette suddenly lurched sideways, recoiling. With her head turned over her shoulder, she coudn't see where she was placing her feet and she stumbled and fell. She hit the ground hard, and the pain made her gasp in the breath that had caught. She began yelling and stammering even as she kept scrambling backward.

"Bridgette!" Peter said, turning quickly to her, "What's wrong?" Peter looked back at her pointing his phone flashlight down to see her. Bridgette was scrambling backwards, her grime-smeared rubber soles sliding uselessly over track and gravel. She was still looking up into the darkness toward an obscured tendrilous cloud, and choking on her voice. 

"I--it--something stroked me!" She yelled, pointing toward the wall behing them. Peter whipped over his phone-light and "What the hell?" he said.

Hundreds of pail, bony roots reached stiffly out from the tunnel wall. They seemed to shiver. Peter approached them slowly.

"It's roots, Bridge. Looks like some kind of utility pipe? I'm not sure." said Peter, "You alright?"
"Yeah--well no, not really." Bridgette got to her feet and walked next to Peter.

Even holding the flashlight at arms length overhead, he couldn't illuminate more than a couple feet into the pipe, the roots snarl was so dense. Most of the roots extended straight out from the wall toward the tunnel center--the few that had brushed Bridgettes shoulder were still quivering--but some hooked tightly upward from the pipe, crawling up the tunnel wall and partway across the ceiling. Peter shuddered, and the tangle of shadow shuddered with him.

"What is that?" Peter asked, leaning forward. 
"What is what?" Bridgette asked, but Peter was already picking away at the growth, worming his free hand through the roots. He grunted a little with the effort, the coarse wood scratching at his soft fingers. One more twist, and he withdrew his hands curled around delicate metal.

"Glasses." Peter said, holding them up to the light. "It's someone's glasses." His hand was bleeding a little, and a few drops ran down the glinting frames and dripped onto the groping roots.
"Are you alright?" Bridgette asked.
"Huh? Oh, yeah, fine. Just scratched me a little." Peter said. He turned the glasses over in his hands. The lenses were intact, if dirty. Peter slipped them into his back pocket and turned back to the root snarl with the light.

"Can we not?" said Bridgette. "I'd spelunk with you any other day, I promise, but right now I'm not feeling very National Geographic."

But Peter was leaning into the root swarm, pressing some out of the way and peering into the tunnel. He could hear a soft liquid gurgle from somewhere underneath the roots, and deeper in, behind the swinging shadows from his light he could make out a child's backpack.

"Peter! Come on, I'm very ready to go." Bridgette cut in.
"Yeah, coming." said Peter, pulling back from the incongruity. His eyes lingered though, and his curious scowl.

# track hub

Bridgette started off into the dark, not waiting for Peter to lead with his phone. By now, her eyes had acclimated enough that she could pick up on the thin slivers of ricochet light caught on tracks, pointing the way down tunnel. Her feet scuffed a little, but at least walking forward into the dark meant walking away from that abberation.

As she walked, she felt her breath finally calm, her senses attune again to the sound of grit underfoot, and Peter's silence behind her. She couldn't know what was occupying him, but since his absorption with the intruding roots, he'd been lost in his own world. So Bridgette led them both. The maintenance train had come from somewhere further up this line, so there must be an active platform ahead. Even if it's purely for the transit staff and maintenance workers, any way out would do--trespassing fine be damned.

Suddenly, where the tunnel had been cupping a ring of light thirty feet ahead of Bridgette, there was only black. Textureless black.

"Peter? You see this?" asked Bridgette. The air changed too, grew less stale, and a faint breeze registered across Bridgettes damp cheek. 
"Yeah. It looks big, huh?" Peter said, catching up. "Looks like there's other lines here."
And there were. Many of them. Bridgette counted three on either side, which was as far as the light revealed. They walked a little further until Bridgette caught site of an intersection. The track on their right cut in and made a gradual exchange with the one they were walking on.

"Shit. I dunno, Peter." Bridgette said, weighing the two paths. She looked up to him, then out across the darkness of the parallel tracks. "Should be bush-whack it? Seems like this is a hub or something."

"Why are there no trains?" Peter said. He followed Bridgette's gaze, dumping the phone's feeble into the exapanse. "...I don't think so, Bridge. Let's stick to our plan." He said, turning back up their track.
"Wait!" Bridgette cried. "No, point it away. See, there."
Something glowed, visible only for its contrast.

# empty platform

It was obvious on approach that the platform was without activity, but it's pale illuumination offered a bare promise of othe people or maybe a way out Bridgette was the first up the empty platform. She was puffing from having hurried across the uneven ruts of several tracks, but threw her arms high over her head, triumphant.
"We are saved, Peter!" she bellowed. "I can't wait to taste sweet open air."
Peter hauled himself up the edge and looked around. "Did you spot a way up?" he asked.
"No, but there's the street right up there." Bridgette said, gesturing over her shoulder. "That's moonlight."
She shuffled over to a bench and flopped down onto it. She pulled her jacket tight around her body and tuckeed her hands between her thighs.
"We'll be outta here in no time." she said softly, to herself, "I've had quite enough of Hungarian transit." Then, more loudnly, "What's up? Where are you heading?"

Peter was walking down platform a little further from her. The surface elevator close to where they'd gotten up had been sealed, and though the condition of the abandoned platform made it a foregone possibility, Peter had walked far enough toward the end to confirm the padlock on the maintenance door.

"I'm not sure we can get out from here, Bridge." Peter said. Bridgette squirmed in her posture but didn't respond. Peter walked toward the source of the light: broken rays, diluted blue refracting down some concrete shaft above. As he drew closer, he began to catch whispers of bustle, murmurs of activity descending with the light.
"Bridge, can you give me a hand? I wanna get up there." Peter said, pointing up the support post. Bridgette hunched her shoulders higher and curled a little tighter on the bench.
"Alright." Peter said dryly, surveying dubious toeholds of rivets and an electrical box, "looks like fun."

# Peter climbs up to a grate-grotto
Once up the post and onto joist, it was easier going. Peter crawled along the beam then until the point it ran under a tall concrete slab. Peter rose delicately to his feet, curled his fingers over the edge of the slab, and hoisted himself up into the clear blue light. It was soft under his knees. The slab was carpeted in cigarette butts, maybe a million of them. Peter stood quickly, brushed his filthy hands on his filthy jeans reflexively, then looked up.

Bridgette stirred on the bench. She hadn't slept exactly, but she'd lost some of her tether to consciousness. "Peter?" she called, but she couldn't hear him.

The grate was thirty feet over head, and Peter could see the fierce blue hallogen lamp an indeterminate distance higher still, hanging from a vaulted ceiling. Voices and footsteps echoed down the shaft to him.
"Hello!" he called, "Hello!"

Bridgette ________________

There! Someone stepped onto the grate. Peter called again, his voice hoarser, and the body stopped walking directly overhead.
"Hello! I need help!" he yelled. Peter could see the twin ovals of the person's shoes, he could see the sway of their body above. The person lowered something onto the grate, to Peter only a black rectangle. One leg extended back. They were kneeling.
Peter cried out again, pleading "Yes! Hello? Please help! I'm stuck down here wi-" A smaller body, a child, bounded across the grate and collided with the first in an embrace.
"No! Please, please hear me!" Peter called. He grabbed a fistfull of garbage from his feet and threw upward. The cigarette butts and paper scraps scattered with a patter across the grey shaft walls and rained back to Peter's slab. The person stood up. The soles of the child's feet floated away from the grate, then the suitcase. Peter slumped onto the trash, the man walked away.

He can see clearly the peanut-shaped (do better) shadows of feet passing back and forth over the grate. Many feet. Many shades pass by overhead. They are in another place, attention above. He shouts again and again, can't hear Bridgette below him anymore from the noise station above and his own bellowing. He grabs a fistfull of cigarettes and throws them up. They make it a few feet and then scatter against the concrete walls and tumble back down. He gives up and descends.

# after the grate-grotto
Peter descends, finds Bridgette lying on the bench again. He wakes her up. Literally, reuse the lines from the first part all over again. Bridgette is dislodged from a dream smear of color and sound or whatever. This time when he addresses her as Bridge, she is indifferent and a little numb. Peter tells her they need to press on to the next station; this one has nothing in it. Bridgette isn't fond of that idea, as if it is the first time she has heard anything about it, but ambiguously so. Peter is exasperated; it was her idea in the first place and now they are in the middle of the problem, so come on Bridge. She agrees, partly confused by how they arrived to the midpoint of a plan she can remember. She's concerned for Peter.

# oncoming train -> exit
Back on the tracks, they are making good and steady headway. Then the rumble and whine of a train approaching. A long line that had been hanging slack on the tunnel ceiling is jerked from far off and sways menacingly overhead. Bridgette is staring back puzzled, but Peter leaps to action, pushing Bridgette. They both get up to a run. They huff and puff, thasting the graphite in the air. Peter glances over his shoulder and can see a ring of light in the slight bend of the tunnel, approaching. Looking ahead, they can see the glow of the next platform. They run and run, arrive to the signalling corner. Peter is flailing. He jumps up, his hands slip. He glances back and yells at Bridegette. She is a silhouette against the blooming light behind her. Peter is loopy, so it's a big wall of yellow, the advancing sun. He jumps again, fingers make purchase on the guard rail. He hauls himself up, onto his back. There's a person there! But no time, Peter turns back to the tunnel and yells. Bridgette takes the last few steps, gets to the corner of the station, and with a scramble is up. The train runs screeching by, then slows, stopping at the station. Peter and Bridgette are panting in a pile. People enter and exit the train cars, a modest early-morinng shuffle. Nobody pays them any attention. The train leaves, and Peter and Bridgette get up. Peter is elated. Bridgette is relieved, but still confused. Peter's adrenaline interpretation is the one we associate with, the one that makes sense. Bridgette is inexplicably cool, like she has had a very different experience from him. While he's bent double at the waist, laughing, she starts off. She gets to the escalator before he realizes she's not with him anymore. She's drifting up to the surface. He starts walking after her, not sure if he will find/catch/encounter her.
