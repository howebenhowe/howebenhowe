# Bodyweight
after Frank O'Hara

when we met it was all laughing
or soon enough after Can you remember
we paused only to gulp air

those fields are all still there
but fancier and crowded with leashes
too much to slip through barefooted

or careen around the lake
funky and glad for slow summer time
just drunk with time

I feel the weight of my body now
more than then but have
we ever stopped laughing
