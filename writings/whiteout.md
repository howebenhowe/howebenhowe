After Rainer Maria Rilke - Go to the Limits of your Longing

"I'm expecting a package that's quite delayed"
When the wind hits you it slows you down.
At first I fight to move faster, still.
I apply more pressure with my legs.
I remain in an automatic state.
I press my effort against the obstacle.
I press my lungs into the wind.
But what of it?
That's when I double back into the music.
That's when I return to my body.
I feel the sharp stings of snow pellets driven into my naked scalp.
I feel the cold stripping my legs.
I feel the shifting of weight from left to right.
And then, the movement forward. Then the grace.
No idea if I was moving fast or slow, but then
that wasn't exactly the point of finding grace.
