# Geo Texts

B: Hi Geo, it's Ben Howe. I had a lovely walk + talk with Madeline yesterday. She pointed out that we could use a little reconciliation. True enough, Madeline. Looking inside myself, though, there's not really much there needs resolving. Back in April I bristled in a writing group at a turn of phrase. No great shakes one way or the other, but it came at a time when I had a few things exploding in my life. I put it out of my mind to better show up for the people in my immediate community who needed my energy. I still feel good about that choice, I'm sure you get it. Family comes first type thing. But, here, months on down the road, I make no bones about that past moment. I don't much trust text messages, though, neither for understanding nor for expressing. Wanna meet up sometime in the next couple weeks? Have a cup of tea and clear some air, something like that?

G: Appreciate you finally reaching out. There is a lot I could say. But wanna actually get into what's really valuable here. Which is lessons and learning. So Ben: have you ever had a serious confrontation with another man? 

G: As for texting being a medium to express. It's simple, words are powerful. Written or vocal. In my opinion of course. Much can be resolved in a few written words. However, if you feel text won't do well then I propose we meet immediately. I'm ready right now. I can meet you within the hour. I'll come to where you are so you can relax. :) 

B: Are you suggesting that we fight? I can't tell if that's what you mean by "serious confrontation". I don't want to fight. I'm interested in meeting with you to talk, but not now and not today. I'm not sure when next would work for me--this weekend, probably. I want to talk with you so that we can feel at ease with one another, and so that there isn't discord running through my friendship with Madeline. What do you want? 

G: Of course not. When I say learning, I mean the only thing that interests me at this point is understanding your process and if you understand the arts of confrontation. 
G: The philosophy must be the topic that we discuss. I don't really care about what Happened between us in the writing club. Or the excuse. I have so much more interesting things in life to dabble in. 
G: But if we're going to do this, it must be fascinating. So I'd like to know how aware you are of what actually happened between us. A zoomed out perspective so to speak. 
G: 1. So that this doesn't happen to you again (with some other guy that's not as understanding and forgiving as I am) 
2. It's seemingly the only way to build respect between us. 
G: Because you'd like "to feel at ease" with me, it's evident to me that you don't understand much needs to be reconciled for that to happen. That's why I'm starting with something rudimentary. The nuance of confrontation, and what your philosophy is on it. 
G: I understand you don't have the time now. I really do. But please, please soon as possible. Usually I'm the type of person that has 0 time for things like this. But I magically have an interest in this. So before I lose all interest I'd like to have this talk :) 

Hop you have an exquisite week, Ben :) 

G: I know I can be very or extremely eccentric. Rest assured I want to extract what's valuable in all of this. With all respect :) 

B: Let's link up this Saturday? Early afternoon possible for you?

G: I have a bit of trading to do in the afternoon. I'll be free later in the afternoon if that works?? 

B: I expect it will. Something like 4? Let me know as is takes shape for you. It's liable to be very, very cold.
