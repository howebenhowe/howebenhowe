B: hung w/ apartment mates. Got a little discouraged by how much compromise on good living is called for.
B: One particular sticking point, Alex doesn't want to just share food.
B: Which blows my mind.
B: Well, I won't play dumb. People have their peculiarities.
B: But I can already see sharing food => Ben cooks for you all the time.
B: So I'm like, coach, put me in.
P: It's just bad game theory
P: Take the advantage, fools
B: James is keeping peace.

B: "What's the apartment like? How are the flatmates?"
"Food stickers."
"Ah, sorry."
P: Lmff
P: I was writing marijuana words and had to bail, if you were wondering about the typing.......
P: What a sad thing to be on the end of typing.......
P: So anyway
B: At last home, I got to let something off the leash w/ respect to how I integrate with the space, the habits, the decoration. I'm really not inclined to re-leash those impulses.
P: Can't you just cook for everyone anyway?
B: Yeah, that's pretty much the plan.
P: Which is a weird idea of a solution
P: Like hey here's a win
P: You just give stuff out anyway
B: But it's a minor hamstring to look in a fridge when preparing a feast for everyone, see a tomato, and go "Wait, no, I can't use that tomato, because it has a sticker on it."
P: Lol i giggle
B: liar
P: I mean this is annoying for you
P: But I'm giggling

P: I got nuffin
B: How you gonna fill the hours now?
B: Get that half-ass do on guitar, or is that box already checked?
P: Most people think I'm good at both
B: Right. You put a lot of stock in other people's evaluations of you.
B: ...and also, that's definitely what I was referring to.
P: What's funny is
P: I don't put stock in others evaluations
P: I don't put stock in mine either
P: Therefore my evaluation evaluation is moot
P: What do
B: You just keep out of the market. No stocks.
B: It's all make-believe anyway. Property is a lie. Remain vegetarian.
P: I think I reject boxes and checks and pens
B: You should open a consultancy firm.
B: One that openly disavows the integrity of its feedback.
B: Mutual amusement consultancy firm. "Let's look at your problems together."
P: Lolol
P: Lean back and cross arms
P: "yep"
P: I'm going to figure out what my problem is
B: "What's your line of work?"
B: "I'm a self-employed consultancy firm!
P: "
B: Rescued from chaos. Thanks.
B: Here's a thought experiment for you.
B: What if we took our present mode of communication and transposed it back onto when we would facebook chat in 10th grade.
B: And then ran that cycle forward ten years.
B: Then rinse repeat 20 times.
B: Where would we be now?
B: "thought exp" might have been dressing it up. More apt: "Ponce my fancy: ..."
B: 2021's "check this" is "ponce my fancy". I'm making it happen.
P: That is a good question
P: I have the video won't load spinning wheel in my head trying to find a clew
B: Clue? Or clew?
B: It's a word, so I'm confused.
P: Clew
P: One from the other if I understand correctly
P: But let's not derail
P: I'd just like to say
B: Oh, my bad. How far back you wanna go?
B: Tryna set new breath hold record?
P: Your thought experiment
B: rd
P: There is richness in our communication
P: You are the only source of ore
P: For that brand of richness
B: It's a funny inversion of hieroglyphics.
P: And the quarry is largely unexplored, presumably
B: Sorry, continue.
P: And what's more
P: The sounds we make in this cave echo differently as we carve new areas
P: And to imagine what might be in in is very difficult
P: It*
P: But it is a good question
P: Another thing
B: ofc
P: What we are building seems to me the most meaningful thing in my life
B: ofc
B: I go to a bday party in the back yard.
B: Love you, Pete.
P: Very well. Love you, Ben.

P: April is paralyzed veterans of america awareness month
P: Which, like most awareness months, I imagine they could do again in three months and no one would notice
P: Except me now. I'm keeping tabs.
B: I used to get confused, thinking "wait, I thought this month was spoken for!" as if there could be only 12 themes to acknowledge.
