# Vee

As soon as the train doors cracked open, Vee was through. He went up the stairs, up to the street. Two blocks east, he arrived to the apartment. His girlfriend opened the door.
"What happened to your pants?"
Vee looked down. Splattered mud spotted his left leg.
"Passing car, probably." he said. Vee stepped inside. He set the plastic-wrapped beef on the counter. It had warmed up, about the same temperature as outside.
"We should cook that quick." Vee said. He kicked off his boots, but one wouldn't release his toe. It made a racket with the closet door where it fell.
"Jeesus! Do you mind?" she asked. Vee snorted. He sat. A few shreds of fake leather uphostery fluttered to the ground. Vee pulled out his phone and flipped through it. He scratched himself.
"Oh, that's what you mean by 'we should cook', hmm?" she said."Babe, ah hell with it." Vee said, not breaking from his phone.
"No, hell with you!" she shot back. "Mud in my damn house! Those big boots! I told you to pick up food, Vee. What the hell is this?" she said. She lifted one side of the meat pack and dropped it. It slapped the counter.
"Meat." Vee said.
"Get out." she said, "You're bing a shit and you know it. God, Vee, you can be so petulant. Go!"
Vee looked up from his phone and sighed. He unslouched and stood. He walked to entry and stuffed his feet back in his boots. The tongues drooped over the laces. He adjusted his hat. It was lime green corduroy. He smirked at himself then stepped outside.
It was cold outside, and raining a little. Vee hunched up his shoulders. He stuffed his hands into his armpits and started down the block. At the corner, neon beckoned him inside. Vee smiled. He entered.
