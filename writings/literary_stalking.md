## literary Stalking

[below, transcribed as faithfully as possibly from train-jostle-impeded notes]
Fella on train. Midday, Friday. Lime green bucket hat with waffle/corduroy patterns. Tan many-pocket jacket like lightweight hunting coat, but softer for its city habitat. Same color timberland boots, laces loose, maroon socks quickly swallowed by tight trousers. Few ruptures at in each leg. Moss dusty patches of mustard-color stains the thighs. Button-up shirt printed like a collage of newsprint. No full stories and the [...] inside the jacket. Lean and angular face with odd glances about the car but most attention leashed to phone, phone leashed to charger tucked between legs. Leans forward now elbows on thighs - which is more [...] Wrists protrude for the curling forward [...] pink, white, green bead bracelet. Letters peaking out, faded and camoflauged against caramel-colored skin. Visible bone of jaw, anchor of hair around mouth and the total relaxation of flaccid muscles of a [...] in his hand, a plastic-wrapped package, a pair of red meat slabs. Tattoos only on one side (r) use stains on timbs. Spreads [...] bent over fussing with laces and tongue. Wets frayed lace to feed it htrough eyelet, folds tongue over toward the tip of the boot, lays feet splayed heels in and toes leaning out and bracing. when I get off, he is redied, and his phone and charger are resting on the meat in the seat adjacent.

As soon as the train doors cracked open, Vee was through. He went up the stairs, up to the street. Two blocks east, he arrived to the apartment. His girlfriend opened the door.
"What happened to your pants?"
Vee looked down. Splattered mud spotted his left leg.
"Passing car, probably." he said. Vee stepped inside. He set the plastic-wrapped beef on the counter. It had warmed up, about the same temperature as outside.
"We should cook that quick." Vee said. He kicked off his boots, but one wouldn't release his toe. It made a racket with the closet door where it fell.
"Jeesus! Do you mind?" she asked. Vee snorted. He sat. A few shreds of fake leather uphostery fluttered to the ground. Vee pulled out his phone and flipped through it. He scratched himself.
"Oh, that's what you mean by 'we should cook', hmm?" she said."Babe, ah hell with it." Vee said, not breaking from his phone.
"No, hell with you!" she shot back. "Mud in my damn house! Those big boots! I told you to pick up food, Vee. What the hell is this?" she said. She lifted one side of the meat pack and dropped it. It slapped the counter.
"Meat." Vee said.
"Get out." she said, "You're bing a shit and you know it. God, Vee, you can be so petulant. Go!"
Vee looked up from his phone and sighed. He unslouched and stood. He walked to entry and stuffed his feet back in his boots. The tongues drooped over the laces. He adjusted his had. It was lime green corduroy. He smirked at himself then stepped outside.
It was cold outside, and raining a little. Vee hunched up his shoulders. He stuffed his hands into his armpits and started down the block. At the corner, neon beckoned him inside. Vee smiled. He entered.
