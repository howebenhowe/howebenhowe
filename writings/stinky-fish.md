# Stinky Fish

Miles, texts, and tickets  
but I find you on the street  
duffel buffetting, grin dangling  

Here: have bread. Here: take rest.  
We fill our cups  
cider and whisky  

you garnish our spread  
with stories  
and snarling comb  

after the 3rd day  
a fish begins to stink  

we elope into family  
exchanging allowances of time  
knitting of ourselves a territory but  

It's not always your  
pipe to smoke not always your  
turn to speak not always your home  

you linger--  
a mustard stain scent  
curdles my goodwill
